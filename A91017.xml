            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One thing here I muſt not omit to enforme thee of, to wit, that moſt of the <hi>Errours</hi> that are rife among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at this day, are upheld by the ignorant runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Quacksalvers and Empyricks with which this Nation abounds, who having not patience to keep to their honeſt Trades at home, doe wander abroad with fooliſh Receits, claiming Kindred, or ſome other relation to ſome eminent Phyſitian, hereby cheating the over-credulous people both of their Money and Health. It is admirable to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what impudence moſt of theſe fellowes
<pb facs="tcp:115445:6"/>claime kindred to Dr. <hi>Butler,</hi> whom for honours ſake I mention, who lived in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and dyed about <hi>35</hi> yeares agoe, a very able and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſitian as was in his time. Many alſo claim relation to him, as having ſerved him, and learned much from him: &amp; this is enough (forſooth) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them credit among the vulgar, and make them Doctours, which title they willingly embrace. But that I may undeceive the people, I ſhall here inſert what I have from Mr. <hi>Crane</hi> a Gentleman of very good credit and repute in <hi>Cambridge</hi> yet living, who was his Apothecary; Dr. <hi>Butler</hi> was borne at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> had two Brothers, the one a Dr. in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, the other a Goldſmith, who dyed both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue; He had three ſiſters, who all dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him without Iſsue; ſo as that relation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Nephew is falſe. As for men hee never kept any, our Apprentices ſerving for that buſines; nor any maide but a foole.—And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there are ſo many men (yea I have met with ſome women too) that pretend to have ſerved him, that he had need had a Noblemans eſtate to have maintained them all. Many of them doe by Ouroſcopie or Chiromancie undertake to tell Fortunes. But no more of theſe. There is added hereunto by my Authour in ſome few places ſomething that was not in the Latine Copy for thy better underſtanding, and two errours concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the choice of Nurſes, as alſo his verdict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:115445:7"/>the <hi>Antimoniall Cup.</hi> If my labours herein he advantagious to thee, I have my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Accept them kindly, as I bestow them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and thou ſhalt encourage me to doe thee any further ſervice to my power.</p>

            </head>
            <p>MY deareſt <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> I have peruſed this Book of the moſt excellent man <hi>Iames Primroſe,</hi> wherein he diſcourſes accurately concerning the <hi>Errours</hi> of the people in Phyſick. It is an excellent and pithy piece, full of variety, pleaſant and profitable, and worthy to be prized by Phyſicians. This learned Author reaſons ſtrongly, anſwers objections acutely, and refutes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily. Goe too (Mr. <hi>Iohnſon</hi>) print it without delay; no clear-witted man will ſlight this wholeſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but it will be very much approved of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in by the Learned, and in their eſteeme it will like the Roſe-buds, every day flouriſh more and more: For it detects the ignorance and <hi>Errours</hi> of Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvers, who goe about to enrich themſelves by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving others, cheating the ſilly people with falſe and feigned promiſes of more then they are able to doe; ſuch as inſolently oppoſe the knowne principles of Phyſick, and envy them that with admirable care and dexterity doe make more ſafe and ſpeedy cures. Theſe, this Tractate armed with the moſt rationall Method of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as it were with <hi>Hercules</hi> his club, levells with the ground, and utterly overthrows their erroneous opinions; it curbs the fooliſh vaunting and arrogancy of Quacks, and ſtops the proud at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of thoſe fond Bablers. For I abhorre to think
<pb facs="tcp:115445:10"/>on this one thing, that a ſort of ſilly Plebeans, and deboyſt idle Empyricks, ſhould dare to take to themſelves the honourable Titles and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned: Even as the country Curres ſeeme to follow the ſent as doth the generous Hound, and (as the Proverb hath it) the Goat would ſeeme to be like the Rhinoceros. But to let paſſe theſe. You <hi>Mr. Iohnſon</hi> whom I know to be an entire lover of Learning, make haſte to print this gallant booke; for it will bee entertained with great applauſe in theſe <hi>Belgian</hi> Provinces, in <hi>Europe,</hi> yea throughout the whole world. Farewell, and love</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ippocrates</hi> ſaid well in his booke <hi>De Lege,</hi> that <hi>Phyſick is of all Arts the moſt excellent, for the antiquitie and neceſſity thereof, and the nobleneſſe of its ſubject, to wit, mans body do ſufficiently manifeſt the ſame.</hi> But be addes further; <hi>In reſpect of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them that practiſe it, and of thoſe that judge raſhly of them, it ſeemes inferiour to the other Arts.</hi> In which words, he ſeemes to point out two cauſes of all the Errours which happen in curing. The firſt concernes Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themſelves, the ſecond all others that judge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Phyſick. Touching Phyſitians be ſaith that many of them are like to diſſembling <hi>Stage-Players,</hi> who repreſent the perſon, which notwithſtanding they doe not ſuſtaine; ſo as indeed there are many Phyſicians in name, but in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance very few, which as in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his dayes, ſo alſo in our age experience ſhewes to bee moſt true. The ſecond cauſe concerns them that judge amiſſe of Phyſicians; every one wiſhes alwaies the beſt for himſelfe, but who is he that is able to diſcerne well the good from the bad, for many doe oftentimes make uſe of them whom either boldneſſe, or the favour of ſome friend, or the proud bragging of a malapert tongue, not the ſound knowledge of Phyſick hath ſet forth, which fault was alſo familiar in <hi>Plinies</hi> time, <hi>Men preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>give credit to every one that calls himſelfe a Phyſician, when notwithſtanding in no one thing can there be a greater Errour; for oftentimes a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:115445:11"/>danger is like to happen by the Phyſician, than by the diſeaſe it ſelfe.</hi> From theſe two cauſes all the <hi>Errours</hi> of the people we have ſaid doe ariſe: For many of them that practiſe Phyſick, being ignorant of the rules of Phyſick have perſwaded the people of many things, which ſtick ſo deeply in their mindes, that they can ſcarce be rooted out by any force of reaſon. For there are very few <hi>Errours</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broach among the people, to which heretofore ſome Phyſitian or other hath not given a being, by reaſon of ſome Theoremes and rules of Phyſick, by them ill underſtood. Nor ought any to marvaile at it, ſeeing that among the learned and well created Phyſicians themſelves, exceeding great difference &amp; varietie of opinions, not yet fully compoſed may be found. But it is not my purpoſe in this place to treate of the controverſies of Phyſicians, but onely to ſhew forth certaine <hi>Errours</hi> of the people, which diſturbe the right reaſon of curing. Of this ſubject but few have written. <hi>Laurentius Joubertus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a frenchman hath meditated ſomething like to it, but he hath left the worke imperfect, and hath unfolded but a few <hi>Errours,</hi> and thoſe not very groſſe, and in my judgment lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerning the people. When therefore I had obſerved here ſome <hi>Errours</hi> apparent enough, I thought good, briefely to declare my opinion concerning them. That old common cuſtome of foretelling by urine, which alſo at this day many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians doe foſter and follow, firſt gave occaſion to this worke, of which, when a certaine friend long ſince had requeſted my opinion, I gave it him in writing. But afterwards obſerving other <hi>Errours,</hi> I noted downe ſome thing touching them for my owne uſe eſpecially; At length when I had perfected a <hi>Centurie,</hi> and this booke had growne up to this bulke, I put an end to it; perhaps hereafter as occaſion ſhall ſerve, I may note more eſpecially if to good and learned Phyſicians; this tractate ſhall ſeeme acceptable and profitable, for unto their judgment doe I referre all. In this booke I have compiled the
<pb facs="tcp:115445:12"/>
               <hi>Errours</hi> not of one Country onely, but of many, that what is here written in the generall, every man may fit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if he finde the ſame in his owne country. And this ſhall be the order of this tractate; the <hi>firſt</hi> booke comprehends the <hi>Errours</hi> about Phyſicians, to wit, about all thoſe that caſt their ſickle into this harveſt: The <hi>ſecond</hi> is conuerſant about the nature and ſignes of ſome diſeaſes; the <hi>third</hi> about the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et as well of the ſound as the ſick: The <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt doth treat of certaine remedies of diſeaſes, miſconceived of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now let us ſet upon the worke.</p>

But
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115445:13"/>there is a great difference betwixt theſe; for well ſaid <hi>Celſus</hi> chiefe of the Latine Phyſicians, that Diſeaſes are not cured with Eloquence. For although the knowledge of the Tongues (in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe whereof the greater part of the Vulgar doth comprehend all Learning) doth make way for the underſtanding of all the Arts, yet they are not acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without new labour, care, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Therefore let the people from henceforth, think him a learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, not that knowes a little Greeke and Latine, or ſome other Science be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Phyſick, but who being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Rules of Phyſick, and well read in <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> underſtands throughly the Diagnoſtick, Prognoſtick, and Therapeutick parts of Phyſick; for he that is either wholly ignorant of theſe things, or underſtands them but meanely and in part, can ſcarcely be accounted a good Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. But who is he that ſhall judge of theſe things? For they are not a few, who having gotten ſome fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, and become renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a certaine name of Learning, which never read <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>

                     <hi>GAlen</hi> makes two ſorts of ignorant Phyſicians, one of them which are meere Empyricks, the other of them that would have a name of knowledge, and yet are but meanly furniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Of this ſort are very many, who, that they may acquire to themſelves a better credit, for ſome ſmall matter get the honours of Univerſities, which they call Degrees, and yet returne home not awhit better learned than when they went up.
<note place="margin">Doctores non doctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</note> Now the approbations of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities have been wiſely ordained by our Anceſtours, being indeed both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary, yet concerning them diligent heed is to be taken. But now adayes great is the neglect herein; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115445:14"/>on many, although but of meane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Degree of Doctour is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, inſomuch as from ſome Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they returne Doctours, but little learned, fit for nothing leſſe than to teach or practiſe Phyſick. And there are few Univerſities into which that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe hath not crept; Therefore in <hi>Itlay</hi> and <hi>France</hi> the degree of Doctour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures not much reſpect, nor is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any, although Doctour, to practiſe Phyſick in their famous Cities, who hath not been firſt approved by the Magiſtrates of the Citie, being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Phyſicians, of whom alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome are not Doctours. In like manner, he that is Doctour in one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie, cannot practiſe in another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe therein alſo he take his Degree. The ſame alſo was well and wiſely ordained at <hi>London,</hi> that no Doctour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie ſhould exerciſe his Art there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that after new examination he be approved by the Colledge of Phyſicians. For in many Univerſities, although Phyſick be diligently taught in their publique Lectures, yet in conferring thoſe Degrees they are too careleſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them to few or none. Therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115445:15"/>it were an excellent thing,
<note place="margin">It is moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take degrees at home.</note> if it were permitted to no man to take thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and honours out of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that he might have his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, among whom afterwards he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to exerciſe his Art, to be witneſſes of his learning, as they doe in <hi>France. Andreas Laurentius</hi> that famous Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Anatomie, when by the Kings roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Writ he had obtained the office of the Phyſick-Lecturer at <hi>Monſpelier,</hi> yet could not be admitted, untill he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine commenced, firſt <hi>Batchelour</hi> of Phyſick, then <hi>Licentiate,</hi> afterwards <hi>Doctour,</hi> and had ſo often kept his Acts againe in Phyſick, as was requiſite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statutes of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. In like manner at <hi>Burdeaux</hi> where I was educated, it was not permitted <hi>Iulius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> a man ſo learned and ſkilfull, to reſide, becauſe he would not be examined by the Phyſicians of that Citie. He would not, not becauſe he diſliked that order of that Citie, which is alſo obſerved throughout all <hi>France,</hi> but becauſe he would not expoſe his fame to every mean queſtion of a young Phyſician; concerning which thing there were mutuall Letters diſpatched
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115445:15"/>betwixt him and <hi>Manialdus,</hi> a very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſician of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> which alſo <hi>Manialdus</hi> his ſonne, the ancienteſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of that City had lately in cuſtody. Theſe are the things, which becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do not take notice of, they ſo eaſily give credit to every one that profeſſes himſelf to be a Doctour. To a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man indeed theſe degrees doe adde honour, yet they conferre no learning. For he that to day is no Doctour, but ſhall be to morrow, is not wont of ſuch a ſudden to become for that cauſe more learned, nor if he abſtain from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, will he be more unlearned than a a Doctour. As therefore I do not ſpeak againſt the conſtitutions of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, but rather reverence them, yet ſo many abuſes can no man approve. For many mongrell-Phyſicians, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this art, or at beſt but meanly skilled therein, having bought the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Doctour in forrain Univerſities, or perhaps but feigning that they have bought it, and ſo become proud of that counterfeit honour, return home that they may bee cram'd with the bloud and wealth of their Countrymen. But for the moſt part it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115445:16"/>that greater danger hangs over the ſick by thoſe practitioners in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, which have but little knowledg therein, then from that know nothing at all. For they become audacious, talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, outbrave and reſiſt their betters, and brag that they either excell them, or at leaſt equallize them. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſome, this evill cuſtome, that whatſoever a Phyſician ſhall ſpeak well, they contradict, that they may get to themſelves ſome fame, out of the ruine of another mans name.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV <hi>Of Miniſters that practiſe Phyſick.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AMong men of Eccleſiaſticall order, that have dedicated themſelves wholly to God, and the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, there are many that do ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and greedily, and with much gain to themſelves, undertake the cure not of ſouls only, but of bodies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and ſtrive to their utmoſt to get patients to themſelves for the healing of their bodily diſeaſes, even in ſuch places where there is ſtore of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. I know this is diſliked by many Phyſicians, eſpecially by them that gape all for gain; but ſeeing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Phyſicians of lighter note do ſcarce patiently brook others better then themſelves, it is no wonder if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue not that order of religious men. But this is no new thing, for <hi>Marſilius Ficinus,</hi> that great interpreter of <hi>Plato,</hi> was both Phyſician and Prieſt, and proves it to be lawfull, becauſe to the holy Prieſt all the offices of charity doe belong. Wherefore he that to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115445:17"/>Prieſthood joynes Phyſick, procures that a ſound mind may be lodged in a in a ſound body. But if in a Miniſter the knowledg not only of <hi>Theology,</hi> but of other ſciences alſo be requiſite, why ſhall Phyſick be excepted? How many of them are there, that are full well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the knotty queſtions of the Law, why not alſo in Phyſick? But ſome will object <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who is ſufficient for theſe things?
<note place="margin">The ſtudy and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Phyſick requires the whole man.</note> For the Medicinall art ſeems to be ſo cumberſome, difficult, and long, that it cannot be throughly learned of any man, but it requires and exacts the whole man. Wherefore the <hi>Divine</hi> feems to be blame worthy, who leaving and neglecting the nobler ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to which he hath given up his name, and hath gotten to himſelf a character never to be blotted out, doth addict himſelf to another, ſo ſlippery, ſo hard, ſo unconſtant: for it muſt of neceſſity follow, that a ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of another art muſt be wanting to him. But they have many things to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whereby they can defend that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular charity, forſooth, towards their neighbours. And firſt, the curing and preventing of diſeaſes is not contrary nor oppoſite to the ſtudy of Divinity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115445:18"/>and to the preaching of Gods Word; for even the Apoſtles and promitive Chriſtians did heale diſeaſes, and alſo preach. Now, though that kinde of curing was miraculous, yet from thence we may gather, that the curing of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in it ſelf, and its own nature, is not oppugnant to the Eccleſiaſticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but doth well and friendly agree therewith. If it be lawfull therefore to atchieve the end, it is likewiſe lawfull to uſe the means that tend to that end, and ſuch are remedies which God hath created to this uſe. But perhaps ſome will ſay, that curing of diſeaſes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the thing it ſelf, doth not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the office of Divines, but only becauſe it doth ſuppoſe the knowledg of another Science, to which together with Theology, it is not eaſie to give diligence. But they may anſwer, all mens wits are not alike, and the gifts of God to every one are not the ſame: Some perhaps are ſo prompt of wit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of memory, and ſuch lovers of pains, that they can imploy their minds in both arts with very much profit. Yea, at this day there are but few, that to the ſtudy of Divinity have not added ſome other Science, to which their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115445:18"/>doth moſt encline. Some are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the ſtudy of Mathematicks, or of Aſtrologie, or of the Lawes, or the like, nor doth any man blame them for it. That the knowledge of both theſe Arts is poſſible, the example of ſome Phyſicians themſelves doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, of whom many ſtudy but little, and yet in regard that they are taken for Phyſicians, they deſire to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before any painfull Divine, but for what reaſon it is unknown. For if a Miniſter do employ that time in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of phyſick, which a mongrel phyſician doth ſhamefully ſpend, either in doing nothing, or in ill doing, or in playnig, as many doe; what ſhould hinder him to become a ſkilfull Phyſician? Nor is it a new thing that ſome Phyſicians alſo are delighted with the ſtudy of Theologie, and verily I ſee no reaſon, why in this our age, where abuſe hath corrupted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing, that ſome Divines may not be more learned than ſome Medicine mongers, ſeeing that many Phyſicians (or at leaſt, ſuch as would be accounted ſo) doe ſo little bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtudy of Phyſick, that it is an eaſie thing with a light labour, to know more in Phyſick than they know.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115445:19"/>
                     <hi>Volaterranus</hi> reports, that <hi>Truſianus</hi> (who was called <hi>more than a Commentatour</hi>) whoſe admirable and moſt ingenious Comment upon the <hi>Art of Galen,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, was made Monke of the order of the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> If therefore any paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ingenious Divine hath adquired ſo much knowledge of Phyſick, that he is able to make uſe of it, why ſhall he not practiſe with a good Conſcience? It is therefore to be left to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether they doe well underſtand this Science or no, let them looke to that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benedictus Arrias Montanus,</hi> as <hi>Arceus</hi> relates, taught Surgery in <hi>Spains,</hi> but few like <hi>Arrias Montanus</hi> doth this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try bring forth. Neither hitherto hath it been my hap to ſee any Miniſter (and I have known many) practiſing Phyſick, that underſtood it well, yea that knew ſcarce the <hi>Tithe</hi> (that I may ſay no worſe) of thoſe things which are needfull for a Phyſician to know.
<note place="margin">Not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Divines ſhould bee able Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</note> Therefore (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the knowledge of both theſe Arts is poſſible, yet that ſeldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; for the practiſe of Phyſick doth wholly turne away the minde from the ſtudy of Divinitie, and the ſtudy of Divinitie (in them that preach eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115445:19"/>doth interrupt the practiſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; therefore it is very probable, that Phyſick cannot, with a ſafe conſcience be exerciſed by any Divine who hath the cure of ſoules. Nor doe the cited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples move me a whit. As for <hi>Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Ficinus,</hi> he was a man more wittie than learned in Phyſick, a buſie man, nor doth his bookes of Phyſick argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny depth of knowledge in that art, and he buſies himſelfe more about trifles, and dreames of the Platoniſts, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſerious matters. And as for <hi>Truſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> he grew weary of practiſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and therefore relinquiſhed it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and put on a Monks hood. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Arrias Montanus</hi> left Surgery, and medled no more with it. And the order of the Decree is cleare in this point in divers places. In generall it forbids Eccleſiaſticall perſons all nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, eſpecially for lucre ſake, which withdraw them from their ſacred fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church concerning Miniſters that med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in Phyſick.</note> 
                     <hi>They that in the Church of God are preferred to the order of Clerkes, let them in no caſe be diverted from divine admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, nor let them be diſtracted with cares and Secular affaires, but let them ſerve day and night in heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters.</hi> And a little after it gives
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115445:20"/>the reaſon. <hi>Becauſe no man warring for God doth entangle himſelfe alſo in Secular affaires.</hi> And in another place. <hi>Let the Laickes who have more leaſure doe theſe workes one for another.</hi> But in particular concerning Phyſick in another place, ſpeaking of the malice of Satan, <hi>&amp;c. Namely thence it is, that transforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after his wonted manner into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, under pretence of conſulting for the feeble bodies of their brethren, and of managing their Church buſineſſe more faithfully, he perſwades ſome regular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to read the Lawes, and to weigh out Phyſicall confections, and ſo drawes them out of their Cloyſters. Therefore leſt by occaſion of their knowledge therein, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall men be aga ne involved in mundane affaires, Wee make a decree, that no man after a Vow of Religion, and religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion made in ſome place, be permitted to go forth to read Phyſick, or the humane Lawes: but if they ſhall goe forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not to their cloyſter within the ſpace of two moneths, that they be avoyded of all men as excommunicate perſons,</hi> &amp;c. Where it teacheth that religious perſons under pretence of Charitie and Pietie ought not to meddle in Phyſick, &amp; that it doth proceed from the Devill, the Arch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115445:20"/>of Mankind, if at any time religious perſons employ their ſtudies in Phyſick. But more cleare is the Councell of <hi>Yours</hi> related in the ſame place.

                     <hi>Againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons going out of their cloyſters to heare Law or Phyſick Lectures;</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>our Predeceſſour made a Decree formerly in the Councell of</hi> Tours, <hi>that except they return to their Cloyſter within the ſpace of two moneths, they ſhould be avoyded of all men as excommunicate perſons, and in no caſe he heard, if they would plead: And being returned, that they be the loweſt of all the brethren in the Aſsemblies, at the Table, and in the Convocation houſe, and unleſſe by the mercy of the Apoſtolicall chaire, to loſe all hope of preferment. But becauſe ſome of theſe, through the different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſome men, were excuſed, and found indulgence: We willing that for the future they doe</hi> ipſo facto <hi>incurre the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, do ſtraitly charg and command, to the end, that as well by the Dioceſants, and in their Conſistories, as by the Biſhops in whoſe Dioceſses they ſtudy, ſuch excommunicate perſons be publiquely pronounced lyable to the aforeſayd penalties. And becauſe we deſire that the ſtudy of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie may be enlarged, that the place of its Pavilion being dilated, it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115445:21"/>propagated, that the Catholick Faith may be environed with an impregnable wall of warriours, which may be able to reſiſt thoſe that oppoſe it, We will and command, that this be extended to all Archdeacons, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Provoſts, ſinging men, and others that have Eccleſiaſticall livings, moreover Pariſh-prieſts (unleſſe they deſiſt within, the time limited) and that in the name ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it be firmly obſerved.</hi> And in the ninth Chapter it is forbidden, that any Subdeacon, Deacon, or Prieſt, exerciſe any part of Surgery, which concernes burning or inciſion, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is the eaſieſt part of Surgery, as to let blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if theſe eaſie things be forbidden, without doubt it much rather comprehends harder matters. But our Miniſters that practiſe Phyſick more adventurouſly than is fitting, intruding it upon the people under covert of counterfeit Piety, will perhaps, but lightly eſteem of the cenſure of the old Church; wherefore I leave them to the judgement of GOD, to whom one day they muſt be accountable for all their words and works.</p>

                  <p>HAving taken upon me to point out ſome Errours of the people, or at leaſt the common Errours of many, I have willingly favoured Church-men (as much as I could poſſibly) ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve alſo concerning Women. For it is not a thing of ſuch conſequence, nor ought any Phyſician of note, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to think worſe of Women, which are borne for the care and ſervice of men, if they doe their whole endeavour for the good of Mankinde; for they know how to make a bed well, boyle pottage, cullices, barley broth, make Almond milke, and they know many remedies for ſundry diſeaſes. But they eſpecially are buſied about Surgery, and that part chiefly which concernes the cure of Tumours and Ulcers: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the cure of Ulcers and Wounds doth require very much art;
<note place="margin">The cure of Ulcers and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115445:22"/>of remedies and circumſtances in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, makes the art to be fallacious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and conjecturall. All which things, ſeeing they cannot be known but by a ſkilfull Phyſician, women ought not ſo raſhly and adventurouſly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with them. Againe, they uſually take their remedies out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bookes, or elſe make uſe of ſuch as are communicated to them by others, and then they think they have rare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for all diſeaſes. But <hi>Galen</hi> in his bookes of <hi>Method,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the altering of remedies makes the art more difficult.</note> teaches that remedies are to bee altered according to the perſon, place, part affected, and other circumſtances; for in ſome a deterging Medicine will draw unto ſuppuration, as Frankincenſe; in others the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy will generate fleſh, and <hi>Galen</hi> gives an example of a Surgeon, who in an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer where hee ſaw great putrefaction, did daily apply a ſtrong deterger, <hi>viz.</hi> Verdigreaſe, and the oftner he did ſo, by ſo much the more did the putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction encreaſe, becauſe the remedy was ſtronger than the diſeaſe.
<note place="margin">The ſame malady in different parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a different cure.</note> The ſame Ulcer in the Legge doth require a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent remedy from that in the breaſt, or another part, becauſe of the diverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the parts. If therefore they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115445:22"/>well all the differences and cauſes of ulcers, as alſo a right method, and a right uſe of ſuppurating, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, fleſh-generating, and cicatrizing medicines, and the reaſon of varying them according to the nature of the parts, ages, temperaments, and other circumſtances, I will eaſily believe that they may be able to exerciſe this Art. But ſeeing that theſe things cannot bee attained unto without much labour and ſtudy, I can ſcarce be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are able to underſtand, or performe what they promiſe. But becauſe a Phyſician ought to be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſolicitous, who, and how many they be that practiſe Phyſick, we will ſay no more of Women, it ſufficeth that wee have manifeſted their errours to the people: Therefore we will ſpeake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerning others.</p>

And it is a wonderfull thing that many ſhould be ſo wary in the choiſe of Phyſicians, that if a Phyſician ſettle in ſome place, they dare not of a long time commit themſelves unto him, and yet they preſently truſt themſelves to a Mountibank, that comes to ſtay but afew weeks, &amp; (as I have often obſerved) men of the meaneſt rank, that plead po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty to Phyſicians, can finde money enough to give to theſe Mountibanks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> of all it is to be noted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the World they are men of no eſteem;
<note place="margin">Mounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks not capable of honour in forraine Countries.</note> and although they grow rich, yet they are not capable of any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Common-wealth; but if they travail the Country here, they are accounted in great honour, and are ſometimes equallized with Phyſicians, and are taken for a certain ſort of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be noted, that though they call themſelvs Empyricks,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yet they are not.
<note place="margin">Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks in former times were learned men.</note> For the Empyricks in times paſt were very learned and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, whom <hi>Galen</hi> in one place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth to have been his Maſters, and they underſtood very well, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the remedies, but alſo the rules of Phyſick, the diagnoſtick and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſignes of diſeaſes, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115445:23"/>a certain method, or rather an order in curing, but did not ſearch out the cauſes of diſeaſes, nor the reaſon of the rules of Phyſick. It ſufficed them that theſe things were obſerved of old, either of the Ancients, or of themſelves. If we had ſuch Empyricks, they might be very well endured: For even Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians do not diſdain Empyrie (the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall part of Phyſick comprehending it.) But they have moreover added hereunto the reaſon, and knowledge of cauſes, not that they may abſolutely cure, but that they may more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure.
<note place="margin">Mounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks are ſar from the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ancient Empiricks</note> But our Mountibanks now a dayes doe ſhew forth their tricks upon the Stage, and far are they from being Empyricks, for they know nothing but 3 or 4 remedies. If they had remedies for the Leproſie, Gowt, quartane A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and other ſuch grievous diſeaſes, ſeeing the ſucceſſe, we would commend their experiments. But not any one of them, in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> have more then three ſorts of remedies; that is, the <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt poyſons; the <hi>Balſame</hi> for wounds; and the <hi>Oyntment</hi> for burnings,

                  <p>The unprofitableneſſe conſiſts in this,
<note place="margin">The Mounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote is of little or no uſe.</note> that of all the diſeaſes which happen to mans body, thoſe that proceed from poyſon, either applyed outwardly, or taken inwardly, are moſt rare with us; therefore there is no great need of that remedy; but if they had medicines for the more ordinary diſeaſes, as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and the gowt, they might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115445:24"/>Beſides there is no part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, which doth more abound with remedies, then that which treats of poyſons. For if any man read the books of them that have gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the deſcriptions of remedies, what a number, and variety of them ſhall he finde, in <hi>Wekerus, Andernacus,</hi> and others that have ſet forth whole treatiſes concerning poyſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there is no remedy that can reſiſt all poyſons: Yea, I dare be bold to ſay, that a draught of Cowes milk can doe more againſt Arfenick and Sublimate, which are the moſt formidable poyſons to us, than all the Antidotes of the Mountibanks. There are alſo many things much better then theirs to bee had in Apothecaries Shops, as that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and in all ages well approved Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> as alſo the Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of <hi>Damocrates,</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus</hi> his Antidote, which containes in it almoſt all the Simples which ſerve for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Againe, it is an eaſie thing for any Phyſician that knowes the matter of Phyſick, and the art of compounding medicaments, preſently to preſcribe ſuch things. For firſt it is to be noted, that theſe medicaments are not taken
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115445:25"/>out of thoſe things that doe reſiſt all ſorts of poyſons; for neither but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor milk, nor oyle, or other things which reſiſt Arſenick, and Corroſives, are ingredients in their Antidote, but they are ſelected out of the medicinall matter of Cordials; to wit, they would only have the heart to be defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the malignity of the drugge, and not the violence of the drugge it ſelfe to be repreſſed. As ſome learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians write, that the poyſon of the plague is of ſuch a nature, that its proper Antidote is not yet found out. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever things are preſcribed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the peſtilentiall venome, they doe only corroborate the heart againſt the force of the morbificall cauſe. Hence the deceitfulneſſe of the Mountibanks Antidote may be obſerved, and that it is not univerſall, as they report. Any man may conjecture the ſame by the price; for how can they defray the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of their companions, and of their journeyes, which are many times very chargeable, if the Antidote were of any price,
<note place="margin">A way to try the vertue of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote.</note> which (as I have often obſerved) with the oyntment and balſame, they ſell but for twelve pence. That the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie of it may be proved (for here is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115445:25"/>a very groſſe deceit, in that they doe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually fore-arme themſelves with the Antidotes of the Shops againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the poyſon) this caution ſhould be obſerved. Let a dog be kept a whole night without meat and drink, and let neither milk, nor any fat thing, which may abate the ſtrength of the poyſon, be given him in the morning, but give him ſome Arſenick, and after he hath taken it, let him have as much of the Antidote as the Mountibank pleaſes, and ſo the efficacie of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſhall be ſufficiently proved. The ſame may be ſaid concerning men, for they make experiment of the poyſon upon themſelves, and take it in the preſence of the people. If they will take the poyſon with the fore-named cautions, having ſeen the effect, wee will commend the remedy. But they ſhew themſelves upon the Stage for the moſt part after noon, after meat, and after the uſe of fat things, and ſuch as doe aſſwage the force of it, as milk, and perhaps of Antidotes. For meat, eſpecially that which is fat, and milk, doe ſtrengthen the ſtomack, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the poyſon; therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they doe then take it more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115445:26"/>which ſoon after they vomit forth at home, and ſo all comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p>There is another experiment of theirs, which the people doe very much admire, The Mountibank will apply a Viper to his breaſt,
<note place="margin">A deceit in their applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the viper.</note> about the left pap, and taking the Antidote will feele no harm. At this the people ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, the very naming of it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But here is a manifold deceit. For <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſaith, theſe fellowes have ſundry wayes to tame their vipers and ſerpents.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the vipers in England, in reſpect of the temperature of the aire, are not ſo venemous as they are in hot Countries. Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> gives ſtrict charge, that in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of triacle the vipers be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the height of Summer, which with them is exceſſively hot, for then are they moſt full of venome; but with us the vipers are leſſe venemous by much, whoſe height of ſummer is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to the ſpring-time of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the people is deceived in thinking that the force of the Venome is ſooner communicated to the heart, if the venemous creature be applyed to the breaſt, becauſe of the neareneſſe of the heart. But that is falſe; for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115445:26"/>is carried by the Veines and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as appeares in that all the blood of them that have been bitten by a Viper doth turne into a pale greenneſſe. And ſeeing that the veines in the papps, are ſo very ſlender, and doe not come unto the heart, but with a great many long windings, I affirme, and it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that if the Viper be applyed to the feet, which are fartheſt remote from the heart, it will ſooner infect the heart, than if to the paps, but ſooneſt of all if it be applyed to the armes.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> applyed the viper to her arme.</note> And now the ſtory of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> comes to my minde. <hi>Petrus Victorius</hi> blames the Painters, that paint <hi>Cleopatra</hi> applying the Aſpe to her paps, ſeeing it is manifeſt out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and out of <hi>Plinie</hi> likewiſe, that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to her arme. <hi>Zonaras</hi> relates that there appeared no ſigne of death upon her, ſave two blew ſpots on her arme. <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo in her ſtatue which he carryed in triumph, applyed the Aſpe to her arme. For in the armes there are great Veines and Arteries, which doe quickly and in a ſtraight way convey the venome to the heart, whereas in the paps the veſſels are ſlender, which by ſundry circumvolutions onely do lead
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115445:27"/>to the heart. And therefore in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the miracle was ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in that he felt no harme from the Viper, which layd hold on his hand; for if it had aſſailed him on his breaſt, he had had reſpite enough to take ſome Antidote, which on his hand he could not doe.</p>

Thirdly, take the juice of Marſhmallow, the white of an Egge, the ſeed of Fleabane, Lime, and the juice of a Radid, mixe them with the white of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115445:28"/>Egge, and with this confection annoint thy hand, and the fire ſhall not hurt thee, not though thou ſhouldeſt kindle naturall brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone upon thy hand. Cardanus</hi> reports, that if one waſh his hands in his owne u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the fire ſhall not hurt him. There are many other things, which by their clammy and cold ſubſtance doe ſhedde all over the hands, that Leade, or Oyle, or any hot thing cannot make an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereon, but it preſently ſlides off; otherwiſe if it ſhould abide on, it would without doubt burne at length. Let us adde to this the authority of <hi>Andreas Laurentius</hi> that famous Phyſician. <hi>They that touch live coales</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>without hurt, doe firſt annoint their hands with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Juices, wherewith they defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the fire for a little ſpace.

                     <note place="margin">Chymiſtry before Paracelſus</note> It was not at firſt invented by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> but was practiſed many ages before him, by <hi>Raimundus Lullius, Villanovanus,</hi> and many others, whoſe many excellent Chymicall remedies, waters, quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences, diſtilled Balſames, and the like we have, who notwithſtanding that, did profeſſe the ſame art with the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts, Therefore Phyſicians doe not diſlike that chymicall preparation of of remedies, although under that title doe Iurk many deceits, and almoſt all Impoſtors with this cloak doe hide and

                  <p>I Know not how it comes to paſſe, that men doe more eaſily give credit to a Surgeon practiſing Phyſick, than to a Phyſician profeſſing Surgery. For in many places Surgeons are wont to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themſelves the function and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Phyſicians.
<note place="margin">A phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian ought to bee knowing in ſurgery</note> That a Phyſician ought to bee ſkilfull in Surgery, I ſhall eaſily ſhew. But firſt this is to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed as it is in it ſelfe, from what it is become by the uſe, or rather abuſe of this age. There are three parts of the curing part of phyſick: One is that which cureth by Diet; the ſecond by Medicines; the third is that which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by the hand: They are called <hi>Diet, Pharmaeie,</hi> and <hi>Surgery.</hi> All diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115445:30"/>for the moſt part have need of theſe three. In a burning Feavor, which by generall conſent belongs to Phyſicians, the chiefeſt remedy is letting of blood, yet this belongs to Surgery. The ſame may be ſayd of other diſeaſes. In Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours praeternaturall, and Ulcers which are thought to belong to Surgeons, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and the manner of Diet, without which they cannot be cured, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <hi>Pharmacie</hi> and <hi>Dyet,</hi> and ſo do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Phyſician, not to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. There is almoſt no diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward, which doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Surgeons art, and the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians alſo.
<note place="margin">Surgery is a part of phyſick.</note> Here I ſpeak according to the opinion of the Vulgar, who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh phyſick from ſurgery, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſurgery is a part of phyſick. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done by the hand is Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, therefore in proper ſpeaking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manuall operations doe make a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. And ſo it was of old; but now adaies it is farre otherwiſe. For now Surgery doth challenge unto it ſelfe five kindes of diſeaſes; to wit, Tumours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Nature, Wounds, Ulcers, Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Fractures; whereof the three firſt in proper right belong to a phyſicall conſideration, and in them a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115445:31"/>formall method of curing is very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> beginnes his Method of healing with the cures of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and ends it in the cure of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. And although in times paſt ſurgeons were different from phyſicians, yet they did never vindicate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves theſe parts of phyſick. That they doe belong to a phyſicall notion it will appeare, if we conſider, that theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes doe not onely happen to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, but to the internall parts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Tumours beſides Nature of all ſorts, may be in the internall parts, the Frenſie is a phlegman or eryſipelas of the Braine, the Pluriſie is a phlegman or eryſipelas of the Membrane that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the Ribbes; as alſo the Liver and Spleene may be troubled with a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, eryſipelas, or a ſchyrrous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. In like manner Ulcers of all ſorts doe happen in all the internall parts of the body, among which notable is that in the breaſt, which we call the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. They that have written Tractates of Surgery, doe treate of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Tumours, without the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of any part. Now if a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian know not the generall way of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Ulcers and Tumours, nor their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115445:31"/>cauſes, ſignes, and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, how ſhall he be able to cure thoſe that ariſe in the inward parts. It is needfull then that he know thoſe things. But if he know them, &amp; that better many times than the Surgeon himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for a phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to practiſe ſurgery.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect of his learning, which now a daies is not deſired in a Surgeon, why ſhall he not practiſe Surgery, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he doth phyſick, to wit, by preſcribing, not by applying remedies? Hence is it, that whoſoever have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any thing of Surgery worthy of praiſe, from <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his time unto this our age, have been alwaies phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, except a few late writers, who have preſented nothing to us, but what wee had before. Yea a phyſician had need to be ſkillfull in that part which concernes chyrurgicall operations, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the adviſe of a phyſician, the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe ought not to meddle with thoſe Chyrurgicall operations, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerved in many countries beyond the ſeas. And in ſome countries no man doth practiſe Surgery, but he that is doctour of phyſick, which is a very good and laudable cuſtome.</p>

Yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders, but phyſicians, when they pleaſe, may prepare their own remedies.

                  <p>NOw becauſe nothing is perfect in every reſpect, it may ſo fall out, that common remedies, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ridiculous ones, may be extolled by many for great ſecrets, which they will reveale to no man, and wiſely done too, becauſe they have nothing that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115445:33"/>the name of a ſecret. Therefore let us ſay ſomething of theſe ſecrets, for they that profeſſe themſelves to have them, may eaſily obtrude them upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and if any man ſhould lay claime to a common remedy, knowne to all, as proper to himſelfe, he ſhall ſcarce be convicted of a lye.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Therefore in the firſt place it is to be conſidered,
<note place="margin">3 things neceſſary to the curing of diſeaſes.</note> that there is neceſſary unto a cure, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the diſeaſe, the method of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the uſe of indications, without which no remedy can be applyed. For remedies are the finger of God, but as a ſword in the hand of a mad man, they are good indeed to him that uſes them aright, but dangerous, being adminiſtred by him that neither knowes well the diſeaſe, nor the method of curing.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the diſeaſes being found out, the phyſician ought to know the matter of remedies, and the method of compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he may anſwer the Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If he know well theſe 4 things, the diſeaſe, the method of curing, the matter of remedies, and manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, he needs not theſe ſecrets, for he is able to preſcribe as good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, yea perhaps better then thoſe ſecrets are, which are ſo highly boaſted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115445:34"/>of. I have read a ſtory of <hi>Gapivaccius,</hi> in the Epiſtles of <hi>Scholtius,</hi> who being intreated by the Germanes to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his ſecrets, anſwered very well, read my practiſe, and you ſhall finde my ſecrets; in which book there is no ſecret, no hidden thing at all. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have heard <hi>Varandaeus,</hi> the Kings profeſſour in the Univerſitie of <hi>Monſpelier,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The beſt remedies are ſuch as are no ſecrets.</note> ſay, that thoſe remedies are the beſt which are no ſecrets, but beſt knowne, as being confirmed with more certain experience, and he ſaid truly. But let us now pry into the nature of ſecrets: they are either ſimple, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. I confeſſe indeed all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ſimples are not yet perfectly known, as yet many lye hid. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any man hath found out by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the vertue of ſome ſimple medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament,
<note place="margin">What is properly to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſecret</note> not yet known, that increaſe of art is to be commended, and deſerves to be called a ſecret; as he that firſt found out the vomiting vertue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony; he that invented the compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and found out the efficacie of gunpowder; he that firſt brought Jalap into uſe, had ſecrets greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; ſuch as theſe, if any man have, he is worthy of commendation, and I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115445:34"/>think no other ſecrets are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For thoſe that are compounded of the ordinary matter of ſimples, as uſually they are, albeit a phyſician doe keep them to himſelf, and deſire not that they be known, yet they are not to be called ſecrets, for any learned and ſkilfull phyſician can at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure make the like of preſent materials. And therefore I have obſerved that no man is more unhappy than thoſe phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that note their medicines out of books; and many ignorant fellows we ſee doe cunningly conceale their remedies, leſt if they ſhould become known to other phyſicians, they ſhould be laughed at. Hence it appeares how much many, both men and women here in England are beguiled, where all do buſie themſelves in gathering receits, (as they call them) when oftentimes thoſe remedies are of no worth at all, and did at the firſt come from ſome phyſician, who himſelfe had nothing that was ſecret. And what though they be good, yet they are not, nor ought to be called ſecrets. For as good, yea and farre better remedies can a learned and ſkilfull phyſician provide out of the matter of phyſick diverſly temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115445:35"/>as different words are made out of the letters diverſly joyned. I once met with a man that had a receit of a purge, which (as he ſaid) a very learned phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician lately dead had given him, which I peruſing, I could not hold from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the fooliſhneſſe of the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he made it up for his Wife, but all in vaine. I perſwaded him to give it to the Apothecary, and that he ſhould give her but the third part, wherewith ſhee was ſufficiently and abundantly purged. And I knew a Gentleman that accounted <hi>Electuarium Lenitivum</hi> to be a great ſecret, who told me hee paid twenty pound for the receit. Others I know, who have the <hi>pils of amber, aqua mirabilis,</hi> and many other ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are to be had in every Apothecaries Shop, and yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them as great ſecrets. So I have knowne others keep for precious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, the deſcriptions of Diet drinks, which many times they believe to be more efficacious, then thoſe that are preſcribed by phyſicians, although the matter is far otherwiſe.</p>

                  <p>Many of them that practiſe phyſick, although ſometimes they are not thought to be ſo learned, yet they are eſteemed by the people to be fortunate and lucky. Indeed ſome of them are very fortunate, to heape together ſo great riches, by an art which they doe not well underſtand. But they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate that truſt to them; for by art, and not by fortune, are diſeaſes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; foraſmuch as to the cure of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, there ought to precede a certain underſtanding and fore-knowledge of them, and their Symptomes; how can it be, that he that is but lightly tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured with the knowledge of them, can ever performe a good cure, but that after the manner of the
<note n="*" place="margin">They were a ſort of people who were wont to fightblind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</note> 
                     <hi>Andabatae,</hi> he wreſtles with diſeaſes. It may ſo fall out, that he may meet with diſeaſes very eaſie to be cured, which nature it ſelfe is able to overcome without the help of phyſick; of which, if a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be but a ſpectator, they will be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then he is a fortunate phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to whom ſuch a thing doth happen.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115445:36"/>It may fall uut alſo that he may be ſent for in the declination of the diſeaſe, or after the principall remedies have been adminiſtred by another more able. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls fortune an accidentall cauſe of thoſe things that are done. Now diſeaſes are cured by a due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of remedies, which due adminiſtration doth not depend upon fortune, but on the learning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the phyſician.
<note place="margin">Tis a right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of remedies, not fortune that cures diſeaſes.</note> Otherwiſe, he that uſeth a remedy, and hath not a ſufficient knowledge of the Art, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he aimes like a blinde man at a mark, which if he hit, it is meerly hap-hazard; from whence it comes to paſſe many times, that ſuch men, by their unſkilfull application of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, make diſeaſes, otherwiſe eaſie to be cured, to become a great deal worſe. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſayes well;
<note place="margin">Lib. de locis in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note> 
                     <hi>If the remedies of diſeaſes be certaine, what need is there of fortune, otherwiſe as well remedies, as thoſe that are no remedies, being exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fortune, will doe good.</hi> But ſome man will ſay, that which we call fortune, is none other then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, which directs the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians remedies, though he be not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned, to the health of man. But
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115445:36"/>that is not enough; for though all things depend upon Gods bleſſing, and are to be expected from thence, yet he doth not uſe to worke immediately, but by the uſe of remedies. For the moſt high from Heaven hath created phyſick; and he ſaith, that an honeſt, learned, and faithfull Phyſician is to be honoured. So that it is not uſuall with him to give a bleſſing to naughty remedies, ignorantly, and unſeaſonably admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. But on the contrary, if any phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, whether a good man, or bad, know well the nature of remedies and diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with nature.</note> and adminiſter every thing diſcreetly, that is, in due place, time, order, and according to the rules of art, a happy event is to be hoped for, and God is wont to bleſſe ſuch meanes, in regard of the covenant which he hath made with nature. Otherwiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one ſhould miſ-apply remedies, if yet a happy ſucceſſe were to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, what a miracle would it be, if bad meanes, which naturally cannot attain to the end propounded, beſides the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ordained by God in nature, by his immediate benediction, ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be directed to the right aime? Although God can doe this when hee
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115445:37"/>pleaſes, yet he is not wont to worke ſuch miracles, or but very ſeldome, to his owne greater glory. Therefore wee conclude, that fortune is rather eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo in the opinion of the common people, and ſo it doth often happen, or elſe becauſe the diſeaſes in their owne nature tend unto health, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomtimes at the firſt view they may ſeeme dangerous; and ſuch men are wont ſometimes to ſay, that diſeaſes are a great deale worſe then they are, that the cure may procure to themſelves a greater name, or if death enſue, it may be alſo knowne, that they foreſaw it, and that the report may be, that the ſick dyed not by the default of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but through the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe. Beſides they often times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe many unprofitable remedies for the curing of a very light diſeaſe, as if it were an exceeding dangerous one, to the great hurt of the patient, who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times might better endure the diſeaſe then the remedie.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIIII <hi>Of Phyſicians which are thought to be men of experience.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere are ſome, who though they be not eſteemed ſo learned, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been a long time practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in this art, are thought to have gained a great deale of experience, and therfore the people doe ſometimes more freely give credit to them then to others, yea though they be but ſurgeons, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries. Experience indeed is very commendable, and exceeding conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for all that practiſe phyſick.
<note place="margin">Without learning experience hard to be gotten.</note> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe unleſſe a man be learned and juditious, it is a very hard thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. In ſo much as it is an ordinary thing to ſee men, that have practiſed phyſick a good ſpace of time, to have notwithſtanding no certaine experience of any thing. Now experience is nothing elſe then the remembrance and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which is often wont to happen after the ſame manner. Thus have the vertues of Medicaments beene found out, as onely experience teacheth that Agarick purges fleame, and Rubarb choler. But this not ſufficient for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a cure; for beſides this, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115445:38"/>is imployed about the nature and ſignes of diſeaſes, and order of curing. And therefore experience alone without learning and reaſon is uncertaine, and meerely conjecturall. For he that knowes that Rubarbe purges choler, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ignorant when, to whom, and in what diſeaſe it is profitable, except he be a learned and skilfull Phyſitian. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid well, that it is a dangerous thing to make an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of the nobleneſſe of the ſubject, to wit, mans body. All that write of the matter of Phyſick, doe teach that Frankincenſe doth generate fleſh; but <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes, that in reſpect of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the parts, the vertues thereof are diverſe, that in one part it drawes unto ſuppuration, in another it is mundifying. The ſame <hi>Galen</hi> writes, that a certaine Empyrick had a mundifying plaiſter, which he applyed to an ulcer, and when every day the ulcer became more and more putred, he alwaies uſed a ſtronger, and ſo the ulcer became alwaies worſe and worſe; now ſeeing hee did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reaſon of this, but onely knew the force of the remedie, it was no wonder, if he was fruſtrate of his end. Therefore men ſhould not truſt to thoſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115445:38"/>Phyſitians, which being ill practiſed from the beginning, are onely buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout remedies, neglecting the other parts of Phyſick; and it is ſure enough ſuch can never be experienced men, ſeeing that the experience of a Phyſician muſt be extended not onely to the remedies, but to all other things which concerne the right adminiſtration of them. It is alſo certaine, that a learned and well grounded Phyſician, when he doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe himſelfe to the exerciſe of his art, will get more experience in one yeare, then any unlearned fellow in a whole age. Which that the people may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know, to wit, that experience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gained but by a ſkilfull and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man: let them conſider,
<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten two waies.</note> that it is gotten two manner of wayes, either by <hi>hiſtory,</hi> when we give credit to other mens experience, following thoſe things which they have proved,

<note place="margin">Many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the gaining of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> The former without this hath noe certainty in it. Now that we may gaine experience, many conditions are requiſite.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the ſame thing ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115445:39"/>not in one man onely, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for one Swallow makes no Summer, as we ſaid before of Frankincenſe, which is not ſarcoticall in all, but according to the diverſitie of parts and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath ſundry vertues.</p>
                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the application of the remedy ought to be made in a certaine or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate individuall of ſome ſpecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is poyſon to one, may bee meat to another, and therefore becauſe I ſpeake here of experience which is made in mans body, I ſuppoſe remedies to be applyed to it alone. Therefore they ſhould firſt be applied to a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, then to an intemperate, then to a ſick man: ſo that hee that makes an experiment, ought to know the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in the ſick partie the diſeaſe ought to be conſidered, whether it bee ſimple, or compound, for experience muſt be made in a ſimple affect, not in compound, and therefore an exact knowledge of diſeaſes alſo is neceſſary.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115445:39"/>For if there ſhould be a Fever, with an obſtruction of the bowels, and it bee cured by medicaments, it is not yet manifeſt whether they were hot or cold, whether they cured the obſtruction or the Feaver firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the Medicament whoſe vertues we would experience,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is to be exhibited alone; for by compoſition the vertue is altered.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> in remedies theſe things ought to be conſidered, ſubſtance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, qualitie, age, the place of birth, the goodneſſe of the remedy, and the time of uſing it; for all theſe things doe alter the vertue of Medicaments.

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving already ſpoken of divers ſorts of men that practiſe phyſick, it will not be amiſſe to point out the errour common to them all; for they obſerve the beating of the Arteries, peepe into Urines, and preſcribe purges. Yea ſilly women doe it. And who is able to refraine from laughter, when he ſees women feele the pulſe. Where it is to be noted, that ſuch obſervatours take notice onely of one difference of the pulſe, to wit, the ſwiftneſſe and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but there are many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the pulſe neceſſarily to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a phyſician, ſimple, compound, abſolute, relative, in one only pulſation, &amp; in many. All which if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered according to <hi>Galens</hi> minde, &amp; the Ancients, they would be more than two thouſand differences. But by us, who have rejected many ſuperfluous things, there remaine more than an hundred to be obſerved. Nor is it ſufficient to know the differences onely; for beſides the cauſes of every one of them are neceſſary to be known, that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115445:40"/>touching diſeaſes may be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Againe, the manner of knowing them is difficult; for every difference hath its peculiar manner of knowing it, which if one be ignorant of, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde out the pulſe. If many ſhould heare onely the names of the pulſes, they would of their own accord abſtain from touching the Arteries, for like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall termes they are able to affright the ignorant, as <hi>Pulſus arythmos, ecrythmos, pararythmos, mejouros in unâ vel pluribus pulſationibus, capriſans, imparcitatus, ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualis inaequaliter, equaliter inequalis,</hi> and many other differences there are, in this place needleſſe to bee rehearſed, out of which wee take the knowledge, and prognoſticks of diſeaſes. The ſame may be ſaid of Urines, of which there are many differences, ſimple, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in colour, conſiſtence, contents, and their cauſes are likewiſe to bee known, but things that are ſo difficult, can ſcarce be dealt withall by an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man, or by a woman. Beſides they are wont to adminiſter Cathartick and purging Remedies. Now they muſt know it is a very eaſie thing to looſe the belly; for many both ſimples and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds doe it, but he alone is able to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115445:41"/>doe it according to the rules of art, that is a good Artiſt. For purges are for the moſt part troubleſome to Nature, and for that cauſe ought never to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred but with great heed and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Moreover they are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that without making any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, if their bellies be but abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſed, doe applaud it, while they conſider not the remedy by which it is done. The ſame likewiſe is to be ſaid of other remedies, whereof great ſtore may every where be found. Not the plenty of remedies, but the manner of uſing them makes a Phyſician; which doth ſuppoſe a Phyſician to be exerciſed in knowing diſeaſes, and that he is ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the nature of bodies and method of curing, which thing very many of theſe cannot promiſe of themſelves, nor others of them. Would God alſo ſome whom the Univerſities have approved, fell not into the ſame Errour, and did not at a venture collect their remedies out of fooliſh bookes. I doe not here diſlike the reading of many bookes, which ſet out unto us the wits of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers, and of thoſe curious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, eſpecially that have committed their obſervations unto writing. But

But a certaine ſort of men are crept up, who gives out that to be moſt eaſie, which hitherto hath ſeemed very difficult to all Phyſicians, and in their <hi>Tables</hi> they profeſſe themſelves to have a kinde of method, whereby within ten or twelve daies (they ſay) they are able

But how is it that Phyſicians now adaies are thought unable to cure this diſeaſe, but it is beleeved to be the proper office of Surgeons and Mountibankes, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the right way of curing this diſeaſe hath proceeded from phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and requires a great deale of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as well about ſudorificks, as ointments, ſuffumigations, and other preſervatives againſt the poyſon of the diſeaſe. The curing of which although I denie not but it may be performed by ſkilfull and learned Surgeons, yet many unſkilfull men in that art, perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills, and ignorantly bring many evils upon the ſick. Yea I am ſure I know ſome, who being ſuppoſed to be infected with this peſt, have been diſquieted and tormented with many Medicines, who notwithſtanding never had contracted any ſuch diſeaſe; for though the knowledge of the diſeaſe be not ſo difficult, yet I certainly know, that many pains of the joints, head, and other parts, have been taken for the

It was of old very ordinary with the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian ſect, and it was a common cuſtome alſo in <hi>France,</hi> in the times of <hi>Valeſcus,</hi> and <hi>Gordonius. Plantius</hi> in the life of <hi>Fernel,</hi> relates, that that moſt excellent phyſician was wont to look into urines
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115445:44"/>that were brought from abroad unto him, which abuſe not withſtanding he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves not, but reprehends them, which like Southſayers doe propheſie many things of the abſent ſick party,
<note place="margin">Piſſe-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> by only looking upon the urine. That there was very great fraud therein, the bookes which <hi>Gordonius,</hi> and others have ſet forth concerning the cautions of urines doe plainly ſhew, wherein a Phyſician is taught how he may deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as alſo take heed to himſelf of their ſubtilties. Yea to this day among the Germanes this cuſtome is in force, even whether the Phyſicians will or no, of whom many doe ſpeak ſharply againſt it, <hi>Heurnius, Foreſins, Sennertus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but moſt excellently <hi>Fuchſius</hi> in the beginning of his chapter of urines, he calls Phyſicians that peep into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, aſſes, cheaters, piſſe-drinkers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy with whom good men ſhould contend, ſeeing they more eſteeme of the gain they get by urine, then of truth it ſelfe. But now a dayes in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the Phyſicians have quite aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned this fooliſh cuſtome of divining by urine. <hi>Firſt,</hi> urine is the whey of thoſe humours which are in the veines: Now the humours are cauſes of very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115445:45"/>many diſeaſes, and therefore urine will ſhew what humours are there. But diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are not in the veines, they are all in the ſubſtance of the parts.
<note place="margin">Vrine ſhews not diſeaſes, but their cauſes.</note> They will not therefore indicate the diſeaſes, but the cauſes of them only. But from the ſame cauſe there are many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: The burning fever, frenzie, jaundice, every ſort of eryſipelas, and herpes, proceeds from choler. If a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cholerick urine be brought, can the piſſe-prophet tell which of theſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doth trouble the patient, perhaps he will conjecture that choler is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115445:45"/>different cauſes. As for example, let the piſſe-prophet reſolve me. If a white and clear water be brought, is he well or ſick that made the water? A man in health having drunk much wine, or beer and ale, may make ſuch urine as is dayly ſeen. A ſick man may labour of a very violent burning fever with the frenſie,

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a bilious urine may be made in phlegmatick diſeaſes, through the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the paſſage, by which cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is carried to the inteſtines. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> diſeaſes whoſe cauſe is not contained in the veines, cannot be knowne by the urine, for many diſeaſes do not ſo much as alter the urine. Such are externall diſeaſes, luxations, roughneſſe, or ſmoothneſſe of the parts, yea, the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane ague it ſelf, which is an inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, although it be an effect of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour, yet it holds forth no ſignes of it in urine, neither in the fit, nor

O that in our times Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians were ſo ingenuous and free. Theſe are the words of <hi>Arculanus,</hi> that learned Phyſician, in whoſe time this cuſtome of divining by waters was very rife. <hi>I doe not believe (ſaith he) that a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane fever can be knowne by the water alone, becauſe of the great agreement of the quartan with the quotidian in urine; and eſpecially in the beginning. Of which opinion chiefly was</hi> Gilbertus <hi>an Engliſh man in the firſt booke of his praxis, in the chapter of the quartane, reproving ſome ignorant hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fellowes, that profeſſe themſelves to know all ſickneſſes by urine, as many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in</hi> Lombardie <hi>even at this day, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of men, who (as they ſay) by urine know all diſeaſes, even the putrid feaver, who nevertheleſſe when they are preſent, and conſider all the ſignes, yet know but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115445:46"/>For as maſter</hi> Richard <hi>the moſt learned and experienced of all the learned ſaith, (looking upon theſe pratlers, and boaſters of their judgment in urine, that in their much ſpeaking are eloquent, but in reaſon ſlender and mute, in his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent treatiſe of urines, whoſe ſingular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be compared with none, in many things he ſaith he followed, he blames them in theſe words.) Some prating (ſaith he) and arrogant fellowes doe exceede beyond all due bounds, and interlace learning with rules invented by their owne authoritie; But I call God to witneſſe, that neither by care, nor art I could finde by urine alone a certaine knowledge of a womans concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor of the epilepſie, nor of a quartane fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for it is but a deceitfull and equivocall meſſenger.</hi> Which things indeed doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much agree with our times. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeene that opinion, which by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine the Phyſician had declared, to have beene changed, when he ſaw the ſicke partie: and which is more, many ſimple fellowes that impudently meddle with Phyſick, being called to the patient, by whoſe urine they had before fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the diſeaſe, not onely to have changed their opinion, but to become leſſe able to judge at al of the diſeaſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

Yet <hi>Actuarius</hi> ſaith, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the liver, braine, necke, breaſt, yea and of his joynts alſo may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by urine; and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes that when a mans urine is like to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115445:47"/>of a beaſt, it ſhewes a paine in the head. In like manner the excrements of the whole body have recourſe (as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſay) to the belly and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, by which it may be changed; thus thinne fleame falling from the head makes a frothy urine,
<note place="margin">4 aphot. 73.</note> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thinkes that the grievous frettings and gripings of the gutts and hypochondres may be reſolved by urine. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to prognoſtickes, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gripings themſelves cannot be knowne by the urine, &amp; much leſſe their ſolution. But the moſt witty <hi>Argenterius</hi> did deſervedly laugh at <hi>Actuarius,</hi> for endeavouring to point out in urine the ſignes of diſeaſes in the braine, the breaſt and the joynts. For though the excrements of the whole body may be evacuated by the urine, yet that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not alwaies, for many parts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though grievouſly affected doe not alter the urine at all. Moreover the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but the cauſes of diſeaſes, and not diſeaſes themſelves. As for that which may be ſaid of the headach, and the frenzy, <hi>Galen</hi> anſwers it:
<note place="margin">Text 4 Sect 1. proch.</note> * where he ſaith, that the ſignes of the frenzy are either thoſe that are alwayes in the phreneticke, and in them onely; or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115445:48"/>which are alwaies in them, but not in them onely; or which are neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in them, nor in them onely; but ſometimes are apparent, and ſometimes not, and happen from other cauſes. From whence it is manifeſt (ſaith hee) that neither in urine, nor in dejections of the belly, nor in ſpittle, nor in vomits are there any ſignes of the Frenzy: Neither doe troubled Urines, nor ſuch as have any elevation aloft, nor frothy Urines alwaies betoken the aforeſaid affects, but doe likewiſe proceed from other cauſes, and if at any time they declare any of theſe, they doe it with other ſignes; for the aforeſaid affects may bee without ſuch Urines. From whence it may bee concluded, that thoſe ſignes which doe not alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a diſeaſe, nor yet folely, cannot indicate any diſeaſe, but ſuch are urines. For <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, that they by chance may betoken a frenſie, becauſe they id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a windy blood, but not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and properly. Therefore (ſaith he in the afore cited place) what hath been ſaid of Urines, makes nothing to a judgement of the Frenſie, yet they doe conduce to the diſcerning whether the ſick bee in any great danger or no.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115445:48"/>And therefore in all diſeaſes it is not amiſſe to conſider the Urine, that the danger may be diſcerned. <hi>Galen</hi> teaches in many places, that the excrements are ſignes of the parts affected, and of the diſeaſe; as that the dejections are ſigns of the belly; the ſpirtle of the breaſt; ſnot of the brain; and the urine of the liver and veines; to wit, that they are ſignes of the concoction which is made in thoſe parts, but ſeldome of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes themſelves. Therefore Urine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew forth all diſeaſes; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the Pluriſie is known by a paine of the ſide, a Feaver, a hard Pulſe, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of breathing, and cough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the urine and ſpittle; for if theſe come likewiſe, they ſhew the cauſe and prognoſticks of the diſeaſe already known by other ſignes. For though the Pluriſie and Frenſie cannot be knowne by urine, yet if the urine appear very much changed, it is an ill ſigne; for it hetokens a diſtemperature not onely of the vitall and animall, but of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts alſo: And when many parts are out of frame, the ſick lies in ſo much the more danger. Moreover, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Urine ſhewes whether the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be joyned with a Feaver or no, for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115445:49"/>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, that in the affects of the belly,

                  </head>
                  <p>THey that bring Urines to Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, doe often aſke them, whether it be a mans or womans water, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the woman be with childe or no. It is admirable to ſee how cunningly ſome in this caſe deale with the people, But that neither the ſex nor graviditie can bee diſcerned, I will demonſtrate. For although the Urine of a young man and an old man, of a man and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be different each from other, yet that is onely in colour and conſiſtence, which ſeeing they may bee changed by divers other cauſes, it will not properly ſhew, whether it be a mans or a womans; for a cholerick woman after exerciſe, and the uſe of hot meats, will make
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115445:49"/>higher coloured urine than a flegmatick man. Moreover, ſhe which hath a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or ſome other diſeaſe, without doubt changes her urine according to the nature of the diſeaſe. How ſhall he therefore that lookes into an urine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne the Sex, when he knowes not the temperature of them that made the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. Therefore if a healthfull man be compared with a healthfull woman, a cholerick man with a cholerick woman, and a ſick man with a ſick woman, and no externall thing happen, which may change the urine, perhaps the womans urine may be in ſome reſpect diſcerned from the mans, but otherwhiles not at all, when oftentimes it is unknown from whence the urine is brought to the Phyſician. And ſo it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which ſome Phyſicians write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the difference betwixt a mans water and a womans; for becauſe men are ſaid to be hotter, and are given to exerciſes, they make thinner urine, and higher coloured, with fewer contents, but women becauſe colder, make whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter urine, with a larger ſediment. <hi>A whitiſh colour</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fernel</hi>) <hi>is a ſigne not onely of cruditie, but of the Sex likewiſe.</hi> But even the hotteſt man may make
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115445:50"/>ſuch urine, by reaſon of the cauſes that change urine. Therefore in this there is no certainty, and it is too much raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to pronounce any ſuch thing by urine.</p>
                  <p>Concerning women with childe,
<note place="margin">A woman cannot be known to be with child by urine.</note> it is a greater doubt, and it is ordinary with women for this cauſe alone to ſend their waters to a Phyſician. <hi>Avicenne</hi> teaches to know it by a ſediment like unto car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cotten, and by ſome other markes. But ſeeing experience ſhewes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is deſervedly to be rejected. It is not neceſſary for every urine of a woman to have a ſediment, but that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is well concocted.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the urine is not changed by the graviditie it ſelfe, but onely by the ſuppreſſion of the flowers, which as cannot be denied, may alter the urine, by the reflux of blood and excrements into the veines. But that ſame change of urine may appeare as well in Maids by the ſtopping of their flowers, yea in all diſeaſes that ariſe from the like ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as alſo in the obſtructions of other internall parts. Thus urine will
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115445:50"/>manifeſt here no proper or peculiar thing. Wee ſee urines ſometimes of a low colour, as happens frequently in obſtructions, ſometimes very high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, ſometimes like to the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when the woman with childe is in health, ſometimes thinne, ſometimes thick, ſuch as may likewiſe be ſeen in other affects. But if the woman bee ſick, the urine is ſo changed by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the diſeaſe, that all the ſignes of being with childe, if there bee any, are obliterate.</p>

                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he objects that urine is as it were the whey of the humours, which are diſtributed into the ſubſtance of the parts, ſo that when the whey is ſevered, it carries with it the excrements of thoſe parts, and thereupon it may ſhew their affects. But I anſwer, the alteration of the whey is ſo diverſe, that it cannot be diſcerned, what part eſpecially hath altered it. Again, the excrements of many of the parts are the ſame, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115445:53"/>of the contents the urine be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as matter, dregs, or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſome parts, the whey will ſhew nothing in particular, or yet when theſe are apparent, except there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignes, can we ſcarce know whence they come, unleſſe out of the bladder it ſelfe, as bran doth argue an affected bladder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he teaches in my judgment a very vaine thing, to wit, how the whey of the liver may be differenced from that of the veins, as if the liver had any whey proper to it ſelf, or as if the whey of the veines be not firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the liver. Now this he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to know by the quantity, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe the whey of the veins is more in quantity, and thicker in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then the whey of the liver, which is falſe, for the quantity of the whey is from the moyſt matter, which is taken in, which firſt paſſes to the liver, before it come to the veines; but if the urine be more in quantity then the drink that was drunk, it is neceſſary that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing muſt be mixed therewith.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> he ſayes that <hi>Galen</hi> would have the urine looked into in a pluriſie, and the diſeaſes of the lungs. But we

<note place="margin">Vrine notes the event of the diſeaſe, and not the diſeaſe it ſelfe.</note> urines ſerve not for diſcerning of the diſeaſes, but for the fore-knowledg of the event. The ſame may be ſaid of a cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which in generall we grant may be diſcerned by urine, but never in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for in <hi>Diabetes,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of fits; in an ill habit of the body, dropſie, lethargie, and other diſeaſes, although urines may be crude, yet they doe not ſhew the affects of theſe parts more then others. Therefore he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, when he ſayes that a cold womb may be diſcerned by urine, becauſe in reſpect of its vicinity, the diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is imparted to the urine. Notwithſtanding, why ſhall a crude u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine rather ſhew the wombe than the liver? Againe, if the urine diſtill into the bladder high coloured by ſome hot cauſe, the wombe, although cold, ſhall not bereave it of the colour, which it hath from the mixture of the choler, and although the wombe being ſomewhat hot, may give ſome colour to the Urine, yet being cold it cannot take away the colour, which it hath contracted ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>

The beſt urine is that which is meane in colour and conſiſtence,
<note place="margin">Beſt urine.</note> what recedes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115445:55"/>from this is evill. Therefore if it be thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then right, it betokens crudity. But that which is piſſed cleare,
<note place="margin">A trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled urine betokens a diſeaſe coming on in thoſe that are well.</note> and is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards troubled, in them that are in health notes ſome danger of a diſeaſe, becauſe it indicates a crude humour which nature ſets upon to concoct it, therefore it is piſſed cleare, but the heat and ſpirit being loſt, it is troubled, for heat makes all things equall.
<note place="margin">In the ſick it ſhewes an increaſe of the diſeaſe.</note> But in the ſicke it betokens an increaſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, eſpecially if the ſubſtance, quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, colour, and other ſignes be naught; now if in them that be in health ſuch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine notes feare of a diſeaſe, how ſhall it ſhew concoction in the ſicke? When any healthfull man falls into a diſeaſe, his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine doth not neceſſarily become thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then right, and then againe thicker, and troubled, but it is rather troubled from the begining, and ſhewes a future diſeaſe. Therefore a troubled urine is never good, for from a thinne urine to a meane, which is according to nature, the paſſage is not made by a troubled, for the thinne comes neerer to a meane, then to a thick urine. If therefore a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and thinne urine become yellow and thick, and troubled, it betokens not concoction but danger, becauſe of the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe neither the ulcer of the lungs, nor the hecticke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> which are properly conſumptions, can be known by by urine. Nor have <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taken any ſigne of theſe diſeaſes from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: the reaſon is, becauſe no proper nor unſeparable ſigne of a conſumption can be drawne either from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, colour, or contents, becauſe urine is the whey of the humours that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the veines, therefore upon the diverſitie of humours the change of of urine doth depend. But in them that have the conſumption, the lungs eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are affected, and the whole body in hecticks, and not the humours. Wee have ſaid already, that the diſeaſes of the lungs are diſcerned by ſpittle not by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and though it be good to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to urine, yet it helps not to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the diſeaſe, but onely to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115445:56"/>prognoſtication of the danger that is like to enſue, for if it appeare to be naught, it increaſes the danger; But the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſaid that theſe urines are fat and oyly, whom alſo many of our late writers doe follow, although they doe not agree among themſelves; yet for the moſt part they grant that in the beginning of a hectick, nothing certaine can be knowne by urines, but in proceſſe of time when the fatty humidity is conſumed, ſuch urines doe appeare as we have already ſaid. But <hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> makes noe mention of fatty urines, but thinne and fiery, and crude, for in regard that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is made by the ſolid parts, if they be diſtempered, the urine cannot be well concocted, but be thinne, fiery and crude, as in a hot and dry diſtemper. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe from thence it cannot be concluded, that a Phyſician not ſeeing the ſick can by urines know a hecticke feaver, for ſuch urines appeare in other affects, and may happen through divers cauſes, and therefore except other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe concurre they note no certaintie. The ſame may be ſaid of oyly urines, of which much might be ſpoken, ſeeing that there is a diverſe acception of this word with <hi>Galen</hi> and other Phyſicians. But in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115445:57"/>this place thoſe urines are meant, which have fat ſwimming aloft, which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> will have to be a bad ſigne.
<note place="margin">2. progn. tex. 35</note> If <hi>fat like to ſpiders webs float aloft, it is to be diſliked, for it betokens melting.</hi> Yet it doth not from thence follow that theſe urines doe ſhew the conſumption, for ſuch urines are oftentimes ſeen in them that be in health,
<note place="margin">4. <hi>de ſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. tuendâ.</hi>
                     </note> as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerve. For ſeeing that greaſe and fatneſſe are made of blood well concocted, it is noe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if ſome portion thereof ſwimme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the urine, as is uſually found in coole broths. Moreover it may come to paſſe by much lying upon the backe, the fat of the kidneyes growing hot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and theſe two caſes are very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and there are few that cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch urine in themſelves: But thoſe that come from cauſes preternaturall, doe appeare in malignant and burning feavers, which we call

                     <hi>ſyntecticke</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſeldome in a conſumption and hecticke, in which no ſuch melting doth appeare, but the humours are waſted by an inſenſible tranſpiration.
<note place="margin">10. <hi>meth. cap. ult.</hi>
                     </note> Hence <hi>Galen</hi> puts this difference betwixt ſyntecticke &amp; hecticke feavers, that in theſe what is waſted is reſolved in forme of a vapour, but in them it flowes downe into the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115445:57"/>belly, for the heat of a hectick is but very little and gentle, ſo as the ſick do ſcarce perceive themſelves to be in a feaver. Therefore neither <hi>Galen,</hi> nor <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> nor the ancient Phyſicians who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved theſe urines, did ever attribute them to hecticks, but to burning and peſtilentiall Feavers onely. But if any fatneſſe do flow out with the urine in hecticks, it argues that another Feaver is joyned with the hectick, to wit a malignant or burning Feaver; which caſe is exceeding dangerous. I have now, while I write this, a hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in cure, in whom ſuch urine never appeared, which I have often obſerved in others that are not ſick at all. And although we ſhould grant that ſuch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines appeare in thoſe that be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yet becauſe they may alſo proceed from other cauſes, how can the Phyſician, that onely lookes upon the urine, and perhaps knows not the party himſelfe, certainly finde out the diſeaſe. But as we have ſaid enough of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull judgement of Urines, I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adde thus much, that it was wiſely prohibited by the Colledge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians at <hi>London,</hi> that any Phyſician pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that counterfeit divination.

                  <p>BEcauſe in this Country the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is an evill ſo ordinary and tremblable, we will ſpeak ſomething thereof, ſeeing of many it is not well underſtood,
<note place="margin">Every pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the body not a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for the people under that name doth comprehend every pining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the body. It is therefore to bee noted, that if wee retaine the generall ſignification of the word, there is almoſt no diſeaſe, which a Conſumption may not ſucceed. But indeed the people doe erre when they ſpeak of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as of a diſeaſe different from others: For it is not a diſeaſe, but an accident following many other diſeaſes, eſpecially if they be long. For ſeeing that the ſubſtance of our bodies doth daily decay, unleſſe it be repaired with food; if the ſtrength of naturall heat, and of the parts ordained for concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be impaired by diſeaſes, the body cannot be well nouriſhed, and therefore neceſſarily the bulke thereof doth pine away. So that ſuch Conſumption doth happen.

And though the ſick dye not, yet it is uſuall for the body to conſume away in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent feaver, whereupon it is called a hot and dry paſſion, and therefore <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> preſcribes a moyſtning diet, in the ſixteenth <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of his firſt book, that it may hinder that drying which the feaver cauſes.

Now, that the people may not be too much deceived, they muſt know that this diſeaſe is not ſo much to be feared in children and old men;
<note place="margin">Old men and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not ſubject to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the lungs.</note> for according to the rule of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in the ninth Aphoriſme of his fifth book; <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the lungs is eſpecially in thoſe ages, which are from eighteen to five and thirty;</hi> and in his third book, the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aphoriſme, <hi>Spitting of bloud, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions doe happen to young men:</hi> for ſeeing that young men have abundance of hot and bilious bloud, and at that age the body grows but little, it comes paſſe, that both by the plenty and heat of the bloud, and by ſalt fleagm ariſing from choler, the veſſels are corroded and broken, as alſo by their immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſes, and other defaults in diet.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115445:61"/>But they do ſeldome happen to children or old men; <hi>to them,</hi> becauſe of their gentle and vaporous heat, unleſſe the naturall conformation of the body do incline to this diſeaſe, or the contagion of another, that hath the ulcer of the lungs, doe haſten the maladie: <hi>and to theſe,</hi> becauſe in an old mans body there is but a little quantity of humours and heat. Therefore <hi>Celſus</hi> erred, who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating this Aphoriſme into Latine, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly placed the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> for the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, as <hi>Mercurialis</hi> obſerves.

                     <hi>Avicenne</hi> likewiſe was miſtaken, who would have old men eſpecially to be ſubject to the ulcer of the lungs, except it be underſtood of the <hi>Maraſmus</hi> of old age, (which in a manner happens to all by reaſon of old age) but not of the ulcer of the lungs. For although incurable catarhes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations of rheum happen to old men, yet the humour is not ſo ſharp, that it can exulcerate the lungs. Therefore he that hath not contracted this evill in his youth, in old age, by reaſon of his proper temperament needs not to fear it; although I deny not but it may happen ſome other way, as by the plurifie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs, corrupt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betweene the breaſt and the lungs,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115445:62"/>and other diſeaſes, but not by reaſon of the proper conſtitution of old men. Which things I thought good to adde, that if at any time ſome of the people aſke a Phyſician, whether the party be in a conſumption or no, he may know how to diſtinguiſh of the divers accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Conſumption, and need not feare the principall kinde thereof in old men and children.

If I had added here the cauſes of all theſe diſeaſes, the ſignes diagnoſtick and prognoſtick, and manner of curing, which once I was determined to do, the book had grown into too great a volume; nor doe I think that to be needfull, for it is my purpoſe only to demonſtrate the <hi>Errours</hi> of the people, and not to teach Phyſick: the people may for that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with learned and honeſt Phyſicians.

                  <p>SOme men are ſo froward, Stoicall, and obſtinate, as that they go about to take away from the plague all conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and infection. Others, although they doe admit of it, yet they think it an impious thing for a Chriſtian to fear the evill, or to fly from it. Touching the former ſort, experience ſhewes, and the authority of great men doth confirme, that the plague is contagious.
<note place="margin">No plague if no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</note> Yea, that is no true plague which wants contagion.; for though ſome diſeaſes doe kill like the peſtilence, yet they are not the peſtilence, if they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, but malignant and peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſeaſes without a plague. The ſcab, or itch, otherwiſe a very light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the ſkall, leproſie, madneſſe, the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Lungs, the <hi>Ophthalmie,</hi> or inflammation of the eyes, and the french pox doe infect thoſe that are neere, why not alſo the plague? And unleſſe it be contagious, it could not be conveyed from one City to another, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens, without any precedent fault of the aire. Indeed <hi>Galen, Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:115445:63"/>and the Ancients, made no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt mention of contagion. Yet <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides</hi> affirmes, that that plague which he deſcribed, was moſt contagious, and therefore he perſwades unto an early flight, and a late returne, of which counſell <hi>Galen</hi> being mindfull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe from <hi>Rome;</hi> and in his 1. book <hi>de differ. feb.</hi> 2. he obſerves, that it is not ſafe to converſe with thoſe that be infected. For ſeeing that whether wee will or no, wee muſt inſpire aire, there is no way to eſcape it, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving far from them into ſome place where the beſt aire is, and by late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe many that converſe among them that bee ſick of it, are not infected. That <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Thucidides</hi>

<note place="margin">1. <hi>de differ. feb.</hi>
                     </note> but darkly and covertly. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents knew not all things, they have left many things to be added by them that come after; many things to bee changed; many things to be more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained.

                     <hi>they are happy in their owne errour, whom that greateſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, the feare of death, doth not moleſt.</hi> Therefore ſo often as the peſtilence ſtrayes among them, it rages ſo cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſometimes in one City it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes an hundred thouſand men. Nor is that which followes of more power to perſwade, that we ſee many men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, who without harme have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with infected perſons, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt had periſhed, if there had been any force of contagion in it. But yet if ſo many thouſands of men, whom this communicated diſeaſe hath ſwept away, and the families that have been wholly aboliſhed, ſhould returne from
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115445:64"/>death againe, they would eaſily refute the opinion of a few ſurvivours. To ſet on an action 3 things are required; the dominion of the agent over the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; the preparation of the patient; and a convenient ſpace of time, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acts in an inſtant. To the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the agent, not only the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue of it, but alſo a due quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is required, for even deadly poyſons doe little in a ſmall quantity; a ſpark of fire burnes but little. The prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patint is either manifeſt, or occult,
<note place="margin">Marſi are a people of Italy, ſo called from Marſus Circes ſon.

Hence the * <hi>Marſi,</hi> and * <hi>Pſilli</hi> were not hurt of ſerpents, and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his finger was not burnt by fire. And hence it is alſo that ſome even in a moſt raging plague, remain free from all hurt, and ſome are infected upon the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. By the ſame occult quality it happens, that what is poyſon to one is wholſome, a remedy, yea and ſometimes meat to another. Seeing therfore that the natures of bodies are unlike, &amp; very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, thence it is that ſome are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and infected preſently, but others not without much difficulty.

<note place="margin">The Turks fear not the plague</note> and withdraw a mans ſelfe out of danger, although the Plague be defined to be contagious. The Turks, as <hi>Proſper Alpinus</hi> relates in his firſt book of Egyptian remedies, doe not regard the Peſtilence, becauſe they thinke that God hath deſtinated to every one his manner of death, ſo as he that muſt periſh in warre, cannot be killed with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115445:65"/>the Plague, of which opinion are ſome Chriſtians alſo. It is the office of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to enquire more diligently into that, whether it be lawfull for a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or a Maſter of a Family, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſuch as be bound to others by a naturall or civill right, to fly, and in what caſes. I will only adde thus much, that holy men ſeeme to have feared death, becauſe never any man hated his own fleſh: for both <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> fled; <hi>Abraham</hi> chuſed rather to expoſe his wives Chaſtitie to hazard, than his own life. Yea and it is lawfull to avoyd all dangers. Though GOD ſend a Famine for the puniſhment of our ſinnes, yet it is lawfull, yea it is neceſſary to ſhunne it; for he is guilty of his owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who doth thruſt himſelf into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger. Who will not ſhunne the raging enemy, who will not avoyd fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, who is he that in ſwimming, if he can will not ſave himſelfe from preſent drowning? Ought no man with clothes and fire to drive away cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a puniſhment of God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded or ſick entreat the help of the Phyſician? God promiſes long life as a bleſſing; it ſhall therefore be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by any meanes to preſerve it from

Yea amongſt us there are ſome ſo ſuperſtitious,
<note place="margin">A ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious conceit.</note> and I have known many ſuch, who would have a certain number of daies aſſigned to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, that it is not poſſible for the life to be prolonged beyond it, and if any man chance to periſh by the default of the Phyſicians, or of the by-ſtanders, they excuſe them; becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſave him whom GOD calls to himſelfe. Thus word by word I have expreſſed their opinion. Which abſurd opinion doth very much favour ſome mongrell Phyſicians, who at hap hazard without any art attempt the cure of diſeaſes. For thus the choice both of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115445:66"/>Phyſicians and Medicaments is taken away, nor matters it whether to a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or unlearned, to an experienced, or ignorant man the life of man be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſeeing of neceſſity he muſt have dyed, whom the raſhneſſe, or ignorance of Phyſicians, or by-ſtanders, or ſome other miſchance hath taken away. God can doe whatſoever he pleaſes: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth uſually work by the help and means of ſecondary cauſes, except a man make uſe of them, he haſtens his own death, as he that hanged, poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or otherwiſe killed himſelf, made his life ſhorter, which might have been longer. The art of Phyſick doth not promiſe any man everlaſting life; for at the length wee muſt all yeeld unto <hi>Fate,</hi> as the God of Nature will have it, who therefore made the principles of our bodies paſſive, that at length by cauſes internall and externall they may be overcome. Nor yet doth it excuſe the Phyſician by whoſe default the ſick doth periſh, but it keeps off the eminent dangers of our life, leſt it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh before the time, and before mature old age. Who knows not that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſhaked, and weakened by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of diſeaſes, and that it is patched
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115445:67"/>up againe by Phyſick, and that by the neglect, or unſeaſonable uſe of remedies, it doth at length ſinke under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? Who knowes not that a man by a fall, or a ſtroake, or, by ſome other way may be wounded, and that he may die thereof, unleſſe it be well cured, who otherwiſe might have lived longer?

                  <p>IT is a common and ordinary thing for many to complaine of the heat of the Liver, and coldneſſe of the Stomach, becauſe they feele winde and crudities in their Stomach, together with ſome running heats in the body, as in the face, hands and feet. But theſe are to be admoniſhed of ſome things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is certaine that the Stomach, becauſe it is a ſpermaticall part, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and bloodleſſe, and white, is of a cold temperament,
<note place="margin">The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is naturally of a cold tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but to thinke that the heat of the Liver can hurt it, is an abſurditie: For <hi>Galen</hi> writes, that it was fenced about by Nature on every ſide with hot Intrailes, that it might more compleatly execute its functions: it lies in the middle, between the Liver, the Spleen, the Caule, and the gut Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and is encompaſſed with them on every ſide, that like a cauldron among a great many fires it may be made hot by them; wherefore <hi>Riolanus</hi> in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropographie</hi> doth not thinke it a thing probable, that the heat of the Liver ſhould diminiſh the heate of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115445:71"/>but rather augment it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it ought to be obſerved,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the forenamed ſymptomes doe often happen in them that be in health, that have a hot temper of the bowels, but uſe an ill diet. For by too much drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king either of wine, and of Ale and Beere, abundance of crudities in the belly doe grow, and ſwimmings, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, windineſſe, and ſpittings doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe; for it is an ordinary thing,
<note place="margin">Strong drinks breed cold diſeaſes.</note> for cold affects to proceed from too much gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leting even of hot drinks, which do not happen by a diſtemper of the part, but through the fault of him that takes them. In the mean while the Liver drawes unto it the thinner ſpirits of thoſe drinkes, whereby it is enflamed, and ſo diſtributes too hot blood to the whole body. Thence it is that they ſeem to feele heat in the body, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie in the Stomach at the ſame time. And ſo they falſly accuſe the contrary diſtempers of the parts, not blaming their owne intemperance. But if they would live ſoberly, and uſe moderate drinkes, they ſhould experience no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſome are troubled with it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they live ſoberly, and ſuch are

But in them the Stomach is not made colder, by reaſon of the vicinitie of the hot hypocondres, but becauſe many melancholy and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent humours are caſt into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which vitiate concoction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they thinke they have a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtomach than indeed they have. Thence it is that Phyſicians demand, how it comes to paſſe, that hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driake perſons, ſeeing they are oppreſſed with a hot diſeaſe, doe nevertheleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with winde and cruditie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The cauſe whereof, although ſome Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans referre to the cold Stomach, yet it is better as we have ſaid, to referre it to the corrupt humours weakning the temper of the Stomach; from whence proceed not onely tart crudities, which come from cold, but alſo nidorous bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, which doe ariſe from heate, eſpecially if the party cat nidorous meat, as fried Egges, and the like.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115445:72"/>are many of them cold, but the cauſe is hot.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AMong very many Errours, this ſeems moſt worthy to bee laughed at, that the huſband is thought to bee ſick, and troubled with the ſame ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes, wherewith a woman with child is wont; yea and many will have this thing to be confirmed by experience. I had a patient ſick of a Feaver, with a very high coloured, and troubled urine, who would not be perſwaded of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of his ſickneſſe, then his wives being with childe. I doe not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I have read of it at any time, nor heard it obſerved in any place but in <hi>England.</hi> It is certaine that women with childe, in the firſt moneths of their conception, are wont to bee troubled with very many and ſundry ſymptomes, eſpecially they that are of cacochymick and impure bodies: Now they doe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ariſe from the retention of their Flowers. For ſeeing Nature is wont to uſe that Flux, not only for the purging out of ſuperfluous blood, but of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115445:73"/>and vitious humours alſo, ſuch blood being retent and kept in, they are likewiſe retained. That blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, becauſe for the ſmalneſſe of the young one in the beginning of her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viditie, it is not at all ſpent for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment thereof, doth putrifie, and hath recourſe either to the noble parts, or at leaſt annoyes them with filthy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which it ſends forth, from whence ariſe the aforeſaid ſymptomes in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, intrailes, belly, head, and the whole body, as vomiting, loathing of meat, unſatiable longing and luſting, gripings, dizzineſſe of the head, and ſuch like. Seeing therefore the huſband hath not in him the cauſes of theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but his wife onely, it ſtands with reaſon, that ſhee onely ſhould be ſick. Nor, if any huſband be ſick when his wife is with childe, was hee infected by his wife; for that diſtemper may happen through ſome peculiar fault of his owne body. As while I write this it raines, yet neither is my writing the cauſe of the raine, nor the raine of my writing. It is no new thing for huſbands and their wives to bee both ſick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it is a wonder, and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thing unknown, that graviditie,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115445:73"/>or a womans being with childe is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe, and that not other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but men only, whom nature hath freed from this travaile, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith. Furthermore it is obſerved, that the ſame ſymptomes do not happen to all women, or at leaſt not all to every one, and yet it often falls out, that when the woman is in good health, the huſband is ſick, yea ſometimes being many miles off. But if he endure that by his wives being with childe, how comes it to paſſe that ſhe continues well at the ſame time? For naturall cauſes doe ſooner worke upon the near, than upon the remote ſubject: And for that cauſe, ſeeing the woman carries about her ſuch noxious humours, ſhe ſhould be ſooner, and more grievouſly ſick. I know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be ſaid of ſimpathy, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, contagion, faſcination, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch trifles. But if theſe things be ſo, why do not maids and widows, who are very often troubled with the like ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, through ſuppreſſion of their flowers, infect their bedfellows and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, ſeeing there is the ſame cauſe, and without doubt they may have a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with ſome of them. To cauſe a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115445:74"/>contagion, not only the efficacie of the agent, but alſo a diſpoſition and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in the patient is requiſite. But who believes not, that another woman is more prone to receive and take the ſymptomes of gravidity than a man, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were all created for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, and therefore one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to take great heed to her ſelf of another. Moreover it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that a woman that is ſore troubled with the green ſickneſſe (as they call it) is married to a man, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding although her flowers be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſhe ſhall never infect: why then when the ſame woman is with childe, and there is no other reaſon of ſickneſs, then ſuppreſſion of the flowers, ſhall her huſband be ſick? Men would be in an ill caſe, if as often as there were a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their wives flowers, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they, not their wives ſhould bee ſick? But becauſe by the very relating of it, the abſurdity of this errour doth appeare, I will adde no more. <hi>Iupiter</hi> bore <hi>Bacchus</hi> in his thigh, and <hi>Pallas</hi> in his brain; but let this be proper to him alone.</p>

                  <p>TO know the temperature of the ſick, conduces much to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of diſeaſes, and their cure, and this buſineſſe requires a long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult handling.

<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Phyſick are generall</note> and may eaſily be applyed to any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For every art is of univerſals, not of particulars, therefore here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, all that are ſkilfull Artiſts doe practiſe Phyſick according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which if any man doe well underſtand, he is able to diſcerne the diverſitie of men according to their ages, countries, and the different temper of the aire, and what medicaments are convenient for them.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115445:75"/>whereſoever it is taught, doth lay downe marks and ſignes which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Countries, both for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prognoſtication of diſeaſes, and indications, which the diverſitie of Countries doth afford, for the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a right diet, letting of bloud, preſcribing of purges, and adminiſtring of all other remedies. Otherwiſe it were no Art, if it ſhould accommodate its precepts to ſome particular place on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Galen,</hi> who was borne and brought up in <hi>Greece,</hi> practiſed Phyſick at <hi>Rome:</hi> Hence

Alſo the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have borrowed from the Greeks their precepts of curing, which are the very ſame with the Galeniſts, which we promiſcuouſly follow. Therefore it was wiſely ordered by the Spaniards, and Portugals, that in India, where they beare rule, Phyſick ſhould be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed after the ſelf ſame manner that it is in Europe, according to the doctrine of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> I know much might be ſaid of that variety of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature which Countries doe give to the inhabitants, for even in one and the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115445:75"/>ſame Kingdome there is a great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of inhabitants, in reſpect of the divers ſituation of the Countryes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoyle, blowing of the wind, and other cauſes, for the diligent ſearch of all which, the Art of Phyſick layes down rules. And yet whatſoever the Climate and Country be, even in the moſt Northern Climates, there are men of every temper, hot, cold, chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, flegmatick, ſanguine, melancholick. One that without licenſe practiſed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, a Surgeon by profeſſion, that he might doe me a diſpleaſure, was often wont to ſay, that Frenchmen cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature and conſtitution of the Engliſh. I once aſked him what was that conſtitution of an Engliſhman, wherein he differs from a Frenchman, by what ſignes he could know it, ſeeing that in every place are men of every tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which things ſeeing they cannot be knowne but of a learned Phyſician, it is no wonder if every ſimple medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine-monger be ignorant of them. For it is a thing exceeding hard to be known. Therfore <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, that if he could but perfectly know the temperature of his Patients, he ſhould be another <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius.</hi> I will now only adde thus much,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115445:76"/>that what is talked by the vulgar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the temperature of divers peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is well underſtood but of few, for all men have their proper temperaments differing from others, ingendred in them from the principles of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they cannot therefore have any thing common in which all men can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. That ſame therefore is onely a certain cuſtome, and inclination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a mans own Country, aire, and uſuall manner of diet, which wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by little and little, without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of that proper and inbred tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, which we derive from our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, from whence it comes to paſſe, that ſome live better in their owne Country aire, although unwholſome, than in another. <hi>Avicenne</hi> ſaith, that an Indian would be ſick if he were in <hi>Sclavonia.</hi> Although that is not always true, for it may be that ſome Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may live more healthfully in <hi>Spain,</hi> than in his own native Country.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is a thing very frequent and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, when any falls into a diſeaſe,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115445:76"/>or is not well, to blame ſome externall cold, from which, he hath not careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved himſelf. And indeed this may oftentimes be the cauſe of many diſeaſes. For the aire is attracted by us continually by inſpiration, and tranſpiration, and it doth impart its qualities to us, whatſoever they bee. But it hurts moſt of all, when the pores being opened through heat, a cold comes of a ſudden, for it obſtructs and ſtops them preſently; from whence, by reaſon of the fuliginous vapors retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fevers doe ordinarily enſue in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymick bodies; but in others, pain, wearineſſe, difficulty of breathing. Cold aire being inſpired, makes the griſtles of the lungs become ſtiffe, ſo that the lungs can ſcarce bee dilated. Hence oftentimes the veſſels of the lungs are broken, and of other parts alſo, and the bloud runs into ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and putrifies, corrupts, and ſtirs up naughty ſymptomes. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing, it will not be amiſſe to give ſome notice of a few moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that all that blame this cauſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are not therefore ſick by reaſon of it, for there are ſundry other externall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115445:77"/>of diſeaſes. Therefore commonly they that live in a cold aire, reap not any evill thereby; but the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even in the height of Summer, and being well clad with cloaths, doe notwithſtanding complaine that they get cold to their hurt. the ſame may be ſaid of other externall cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. In one and the ſame City, there are many that breath in the ſame aire, uſe the ſame exerciſes, and the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, yet when they fall into diſeaſes, they are troubled with ſundry, and in every reſpect, different diſeaſes. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhall ſay that he is ſick through a ſurfeit of meats or drinks, perhaps he had eaten or drunk as largely a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times before, and without any harm to himſelf: which in like manner may be ſaid of cold aire, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate labour; when many a time hee hath endured a colder aire, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the ſame labour without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt hurt, it is a wonder how now he ſhould bee ſick thereby. So we often ſee the laſt meat, or that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that one hath laſt uſed, or the laſt cold which he hath taken before the diſeaſe, to be blamed, as alſo the laſt remedy is thought to have procured
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115445:77"/>health. Where it is to be noted, that theſe are called externall cauſes, and that they doe not alwayes, and at every time affect the body, but then onely when an inward diſpoſition lurks in the body, and a morbous preparation, which ſuch cauſes do ſtir up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> they muſt take notice, that thoſe externall cauſes doe vaniſh away, and continue not, but their effects, to wit, the diſeaſes ſtirred up by the inward cauſes do remain in the body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the contemplation of externall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is not always neceſſary for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or curing of diſeaſes, but of the internall alone, which ſtirre up, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the diſeaſe. For wee ſee a diſeaſe that hath had its beginning from a cold aire, nevertheleſſe not to be cured, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the temper of the aire be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but often to continue hard to be cured.</p>
                  <p>From whence alſo, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is to be noted, that remedies are not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured according to the nature of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cauſes, for they indicate nothing. For ſo hot things ſhould bee alwayes good for them, in whom cold hoth been the cauſe of the beginning of a diſeaſe, which is not true, for many times cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115445:78"/>things doe profit more. From a cool aire, as we have ſaid, many times burning feavers doe ariſe; as alſo from baths that are too cold, whereby the pores of the body are ſtopped, and the fuliginous vapours retained, by which the bloud is inflamed. If the people doe here (as uſually they are wont) encounter the diſeaſe with remedies that are of a heating quality, they will be ſo farre from vanquiſhing the diſeaſe, as that they will rather increaſe it more. In this caſe inward cooling me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and as <hi>Galen</hi> often teaches, letting of bloud is the principall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: In the eighth book of <hi>Method</hi> hee lets bloud in a diary, that is generated by the obſtruction of the ſkinne, leſt there follow putrefaction. For though the externall cauſe bee cold, yet the internall, to which alone the cure is to applyed, is often hot, and is made ſo by reaſon of the corrupt humours that are kept in.</p>

Yet now a dayes ſome doe ſo much abhorre from the uſe thereof, that they think it almoſt preſent poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now they think that the waters in England, in reſpect of the coldneſſe of the Climate, are more crude, and not ſo pure and wholſome as thoſe in France, Spain, and the hot Countries. And indeed every one ought to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of the goodneſſe of the waters. The beſt is diſcerned by the ſmell, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115445:79"/>taſte, levity of it in the hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres, and by the quick and ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of heat and cold. So as that is beſt which is bright and cleare to the ſight, taſtes and ſmells of nothing at all, as alſo which is the lighteſt, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſoon paſſes through the belly. Since then ſuch water may bee found every where,
<note place="margin">Good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters even in cold climates.</note> even in the moſt frozen Countries, and I have often found ſuch in this Country, we may conjecture of their groſſe errour, that doe generally condemne their owne Country waters. Now this is their errour, that by the coldneſſe of the Country they reckon the goodneſs or unwholſomeneſſe of the water; hence they think that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively cold, and therefore crude, and hard of digeſtion, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Which thing is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for the water borrowes not its crudity or goodneſſe from the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heat of the Sun cannot warm the water in the bowels of the Earth, for it cannot penetrate ſo far, which ſcarce pierces through the roofs of our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto us. This doe the cellars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth manifeſt, which in the height of Summer are exceeding cold. But if the Sunne bee not the cauſe of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115445:79"/>this, much leſſe can the parts of the world, which are hot onely becauſe of the propinquity, or remoteneſſe of the Sunne. Therefore others doe more rightly blame the cold or heat of the earth it ſelf: for if the heat of the earth be moderate; the water is well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but if there be burnings in the earth, it breaks out either hot, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo as all ſorts of water may ſpring forth in any part of the world, which is eſpecially to be underſtood, if they be drawn out of the fountaine it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bee altered by the cold aire. To this adde the manner of tranſcolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that is the pureſt,
<note place="margin">What wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the beſt.</note> not which lyes open towards the Sunne, or runnes Eaſtward, but that which is beſt ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For in its own nature it is a ſimple body, which unleſſe it be tinctured with ſome other mixture, will alwaies in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place be of equall goodneſſe. Therefore that which is well ſtrained, and ſo purged from dregs, is the beſt, in as much as it comes nearer to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of its owne nature, and is free from the mixture of another matter. Therefore ſeeing this is done by the tranſcolation and thorough-ſtraining, there is no doubt but every where good
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115445:80"/>and evill waters may ſpring forth, as the ſtraining through is made better or worſe. Now this depends upon the nature of the earth. On this Errour hangs another;

                  <p>IT ſeems to the common people to be a hainous offence, often to change the linnen uſed about the ſick. For they think that the ſick are enfeebled and weakened thereby. This Errour <hi>Holle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in his chapter of the burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and <hi>Rondeletius</hi> in his chapter of the Feaver <hi>Synochus,</hi> have noted among their countrymen, and reproved, but they give no reaſon for it; yet they bid that the linnen about the ſick bee often changed: For by long keeping of them, three inconveniences doe happen to the ſick: To wit,
<note place="margin">3. Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences by foule lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</note> the tranſpiration of the body is hindred; ſweat and filth are hept in their ſhirts, which doe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie and contract an ill favour; the ſweat and filth doe obſtruct the body, and ſo double the heat: Which three things what great hurt they bring to the ſick, and the healthfull alſo, all Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans know. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> bids that all things be kept clean about the ſick, and <hi>Galen</hi> ſtudies by all meanes to preſerve tranſpiration free, that the cold aire may be attracted, and filthy vapours exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115445:81"/>eſpecially in continuall Feavers, in which for the moſt part the Feaver comes by the obſtruction of the pores of the ſkinne. Therefore theſe being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, both by the filth and the ſweat, there followes a retention of the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vapours, and thereby the Feaver which was before, is encreaſed, or is kindled afreſh. On the contrary, it can ſcarce be, that he whoſe body doth tranſpire well, and ſo is free and open, ſhould fall into grievous and dangerous diſeaſes. The Ancients that did not uſe linnen, did keep a frequent uſe of baths and frictions, whereby the body was opened, and cleanſed. Adde to this, that the excrements being retained doe putrifie, and the ſweat ſtinks, from whence ſucceeds an encreaſe of the feaveriſh heat, nor doth that evacuation by the pores of the ſkin commodiouſly enſue. Therefore it is very good often to change the linnen about the ſick, and when they ſweat diligently to wipe or cleanſe their body.</p>

                     <hi>LEſſius</hi> the Jeſuite, a moſt learned man, in his Eloquent Diet-booke, hath ſo endeavoured to mote out every mans courſe of Diet, that he would have twelve ounces to be a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of meat for any man, and fourteene of drinſte, which he that will obſerve, ought to refuſe no kinde of meat which the people uſes, nor ſhall he eaſily fall into diſeaſes, through fulneſſe or ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but ſhall alwaies be furniſhed with a lively body, and cheerfull mind. All which is true of ſobriety in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.

                     <hi>For the ſtudy of health is not to eat too much-meat and to be quick to labour.</hi> But that quantity of meat ſeems to me not to be agreeable with the opinion of Phyſicians; for the ſame quantitie of meat cannot be ſufficient for all men, but it muſt be diverſe in reſpect of times and places, kindes of meat, exerciſes, labours, and nature of him that takes it. He ſeems to have accommodated that courſe of diet principally to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men. In Summer a leſſe, in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a greater quantity of meat is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, becauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Some meats are very nouriſhing, of which a ſmall quantity doth ſuffice; ſome nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing but little, which ought to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a greater quantitie. Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his book <hi>de veteri Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ</hi> ſaid well, that neither the meaſure, nor waight, nor quantity can be known, nor any other certainty be found, then by the ſenſe of the body. So <hi>Galen</hi> teaches,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Aph.</hi> 27.</note> that ſuch a quantity is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, as may not burden the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Aph.</hi> 5.</note> And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is plaine, <hi>that a ſlender diet is more dangerous for thoſe that are in health, than a full diet.</hi> To whom <hi>Celſus</hi> doth aſſent, who perſwades to meat twice a day,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Capa. lib.</hi> 1.</note> rather than but once, and alwaies to eate liberally, ſo that it may be well concocted. The ſame <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> writes, that a man in health, and that is at his own libertie, ought to tie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to no lawes; yea, that ſometimes he ſhould eat and drinke liberally. Diet is indicated by the ſtrength, now the ſtrength indicates a preſervation of it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115445:82"/>ſelfe; but ſuch a diet doth not preſerve but diminiſh ſtrength,
<note place="margin">Diet is threefold.</note> and exhauſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat. Phyſicians make a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference of diet; <hi>Slender,</hi> which impaires ſtrength; <hi>moderate,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſtrength; and <hi>full,</hi> which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it. Now a ſlender diet is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the healthfull, but for the ſick onely.

But in them that be in health, the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is alwaies to bee preſerved, or to bee augmented by food, not to bee impaired: Now a full diet doth encreaſe ſtrength, a amoderate preſerves it, and a ſpare diet doth diminiſh it, therefore in health, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies good to avoid this ſpare diet: But it will not be amiſſe to uſe either of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether it be a full diet, or it concern the upholding or maintaining of ſtrength by a moderate diet, as the preſent ſtate ſhall ſeem to require; as</hi> Galen <hi>teaches in his Comment upon the fourth Aphoriſme of the firſt book.</hi> But if there be any found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the holy Fathers, that have lived to the hundreth yeare of their age in continuall faſtings, and extreame abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meat and drinke, that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>
                     <hi>HIppocrates</hi> ſaid wel in his firſt Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme, that not only the Phyſician, but the by-ſtanders, and the ſick himſelfe alſo ought to doe their duty, otherwiſe remedies cannot be fitly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, if what the Phyſician hath rightly preſcribed, the by-ſtanders doe either omit, or uſe unſeaſonably, or attempt any thing about the ſick, which afterwards may prove hurtfull to him, without the advice of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. And therefore in this Chapter wee will ſpeake ſomewhat of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders. For thoſe women that ſerve the ſick, as alſo the kinsfolks and friends that come to viſit the ſick, doe uſually obtrude upon his abundance of meat, and that very often, as they ſay, to uphold his ſtrength, alwayes fearing leſt he dye with hunger. Their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truly is very good, for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the ſtrength is the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man. Now the diet hath eſpecially regard unto the entire ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the ſtrength, and by accident unto the cure, in as much as it ought to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115445:84"/>reſiſt the diſeaſe and its cauſe.
<note place="margin">Athreefold errour in the point of diet.</note> But they commonly erre in quantity, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and time, wherewith the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not only of meats, but of all remedies are wont to bee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. As concerning the quantity, (for we will begin with with it) it is to be noted, that the ſick have the cauſes of diſeaſes lurking within them, which do impaire their ſtrength; now meat, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth by its owne nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſtrength, yet it doth not ſubdue the cauſes of diſeaſes, from whence it comes to paſſe, that the diſeaſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbids the meat, which the ſtrength requires: therefore <hi>the more more you nouriſh impure bodies,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ach.</hi> 10. <hi>lib</hi> 2. A good civeat.</note> the more you hurt them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Which thing all they ought to conſider, who who while they buſie themſelves to help the ſick, doe thruſt them into a ſure deſtruction, and whether the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician command or forbid any thing, yet they doe of their own accord what they pleaſe. It is an ordinary thing for the ſick, eſpecially ſuch as bee ſick of feavers, for whom principally keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are provided, to refuſe meat, by reaſon of ill humours that oppreſſe the ſtomack, by which, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115445:84"/>his Commentaries, the meat is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo the ill humours are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and their quality not amended at all; hence it is ſo farre from increaſing the ſtrength,
<note place="margin">It is not the eating of meat, but the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of what is eaten that nouriſheth</note> as that it is rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thereby; for as the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid well in another place, the body is not nouriſhed by thoſe things which are taken into it, but by thoſe which being taken, are well concocted, which is not uſuall in ſick perſons. For a weak ſtomack doth not well concoct meat, but it is rather corrupted by the abundance and contagion of vitious humours,
<note place="margin">7 <hi>Aph.</hi> 65.</note> and ſo it nouriſheth the cauſe of the diſeaſe. Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid well, <hi>If any give meat to one in a feaver, as it is ſtrength to the healthfull, ſo it is a diſeaſe to the ſick.</hi> In <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> his dayes, as well as in our age, they erred in their manner of diet, as hee complaines in his firſt book <hi>of the diet of Acute diſeaſes.</hi> And therefore after his counſell it is beſt to uſe a ſlender diet, which if it may ſuffice them that be in health, as we ſaid in the former Chapter, much more the ſick; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more ought not to bee given to them then their ſtrength can digeſt. Here alſo the nature of diſeaſes is to be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115445:85"/>obſerved, for ſome are <hi>Chronicall,</hi> in which it is lawfull to nouriſh more; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Acute,</hi> in which a ſpare diet is very convenient.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Aph.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>When a diſeaſe is very acute, the patient hath exceeding great labours, and an exceeding ſpare diet is to be uſed; but when it is not acute, but it is convenient to uſe a full diet, ſo much meat is to bee taken as the diſeaſe abateth of extreames.</hi> And in the following A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme, <hi>When the diſeaſe is in the height, then the patient muſt uſe a very ſpare diet;</hi> becauſe, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes in his Comment; nature muſt not bee withdrawn from the concoction of the humours to the concoction of meat: Therefore ſeeing that according to the ſtrength of the party, and nature of the diſeaſe, the quantity of food is to bee judged, and that a great part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy doth conſiſt in food ſeaſonably adminiſtred, the by-ſtanders ought not importunately to obtrude it, eſpecially women, who are alwayes afraid leſt the ſick dye with hunger. Yet I doe not altogether diſallow of meat, for by it alone is the ſtrength preſerved. But I have in this Chapter inſinuated, that the quantity, quality, and time of uſing it,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115445:85"/>ought to bee preſcribed by the advice and counſell of Phyſicians.</p>

                  <p>IT is an uſuall thing likewiſe for them to erre, not only in quantity, but in quality alſo. For they are often wont to offer to the ſick, yea to ſuch as bee ſick of feavers, divers ſtrengthening meats, as they call them; as ale boyled with eggs, mace, nutmeg, and cynamon, and other meats which they call by ſundry names; yea, and they urge them ſometimes to take ſolid meats; but all this very fooliſhly.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> it is certaine, that ſolid meats are unfit for the ſick, ſeeing they cannot be well concocted by the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.
<note place="margin">Supping meats ſooner nouriſh then ſolid meats.</note> But thoſe meats that are to be ſupped, are more eaſily overcome by the ſtomack, and doe ſooneſt nouriſh; and therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perſwades to nouriſh the ſick with ſupping meats, rather than with ſolid meats. For by ſuch a diet nature is ſooner ſtrengthened, and is not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the conflict which it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the diſeaſe.

                     <hi>It is more eaſie to bee filled with drinkes than with meat:</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:115445:86"/>where by drinkes he meanes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is taken by ſupping, as interpreters obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to obſerved, that in the healthfull, meats ought to be alike, becauſe the naturall ſtate doth require to be preſerved, but every thing is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by things that are alike: But in the ſick, the quality of meats ought to reſiſt the diſeaſe, that there may be medicine in meat, for to every diſeaſe its contrary muſt be applyed: <hi>To a hot nature,
<note place="margin">6 <hi>Epid. ſect.</hi> 6.</note> cooling, drinking of water, reſt;</hi> From whence it comes to paſſe, that they that goe about to ſtrengthen the ſick with ſuch a diet, doe oftentimes more hurt to them, and more increaſe the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and ſo the ſtrength is more impaired. Therefore the judgment of a Phyſician is alwayes to be uſed; nor ought the by-ſtanders raſhly to exhibite any thing, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is profitable to the healthfull, for the ſame doth prove many times very hurtfull to the ſick. And let this ſuffice to be ſaid in this place; for the larger explication of this ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them that write of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Phyſick. For it is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to teach Phyſick, but onely to

Now he doth not here onely forbid to give meat in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115445:87"/>fit, but alſo to compell the ſick to take it; for it is the faſhion of many to urge them to eat. For while nature in the fit wreſtles againſt the diſeaſe, it is but little intent upon digeſting the meat, whereby it comes to paſſe, that it being unconcocted doth encreaſe the diſeaſe, and the ſymptomes thereof. Now what what harme comes by the unſeaſonable eating of meat,

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is the increaſing and lengthning of the paroxyſmes and the diſeaſe; for the matter of the diſeaſe, and the meat cannot be well concocted together, and therefore excrements are neceſſarily increaſed, which doe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward increaſe inflammations, heats, and other ſymptomes of the diſeaſe it ſelfe. But becauſe there is a certaine caſe, wherein it is not onely lawfull,
<note place="margin">In what caſe it may do good to nouriſh the ſick.</note> but alſo neceſſary to nouriſh the ſick in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſme, to wit, when the ſick is of an hot and dry temper, hath the mouth of of his ſtomach feeble, and of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

At that time to nouriſh with thoſe things which corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate the ſtomach, <hi>Galen</hi> judges it to be moſt profitable; 10. <hi>Method. cap.</hi> 3. where he tels the ſtory of a young man, who in Summer lying ſick of a Tertian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did eat meat in his fit, he fell into a Syncope. But this caſe is very rare, and requires not a little ſkill and judgement in the Phyſician, and exceeds the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the vulgar, and therefore it is not ſafe to imitate this without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a prudent Phyſician. All which I have ſaid, that men may ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they ought not adventurouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to uſe thoſe remedies, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeeme to be moſt familiar with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for in the application of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, many things are to beloonſiderect, which the ſkilfull Phyſician alone doth know. But many that adveaturoufly practiſe Phyſick are ignorant of them, who take care onely that they may get popular applauſe, and pleaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they may ſeem to be ſolicitous for the ſtrength of the ſick, the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of which nevertheleſſe doth not depend on words, but on the ſeaſonable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115445:88"/>adminiſtration of remedies. Let all men know therefore, that the ſick ought not alwaies to be obeyed, as if he deſire that which is hurtfull to him.

                     <hi>But in theſe things</hi> (ſaith Hippocrates) <hi>the ſick are to be obeyed. Namely, that their meate and drinke be cleanly dreſſed,
<note place="margin">When good to obey the ſick.</note> that thoſe things be pleaſant which they ſee, and ſoft which they touch, provided they hurt not too much, and that they be eaſie to be amended, as the adminiſtring of cold water when there is need, and ſuch like.</hi> So <hi>Avicenne</hi> in the third Section of his firſt booke, wils that thoſe things which are deſired of the ſick be granted, ſo as no harme come to the body.

From what hath been already ſaid another errour is conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for in Agues, when the ſick are cold all over their body, they give them drink both actually hot, and very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they may drive away the cold fit, which is contrary to the judgement of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>

Hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commands when the feet are cold, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain both from ſupping meats, &amp; drink; for drink, eſpecially if it be hot, is ſoon corrupted, and exaſperates the aguiſh heat; therefore in the beginning it is beſt to give nothing at all, but when the heat hath deſcended to the feet (as the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith) ſomething may be given, but it muſt be ſuch as is not hurtfull for the diſeaſe, as thoſe hot drinkes uſually are.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the drinke called a Poſſet.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is an ordinary thing to preſeribe for the ſick a Poſſet to drink; now it is made of curded milk, which I doe not diſallow, in that it hath the vertue of whey, which is opening. But I will here only note ſome abuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that ſometimes the milk is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated with ſtrong Ale, or Wine, either French or Spaniſh, and then as it may indeed fitly, profitably, and delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be given to the healthfull, ſo it hurts them that be ſick of Feavers, and of any cholerick diſeaſe; for it hearts the body, increaſeth the cauſes of Feavers, inflames the Liver, by reaſon of its ſweetneſſe, and penetrating quality, troubles the head, and cauſes the ſame evils, which the drinking of wine is ſaid to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that are ſick of Feavers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this drinke is alwaies admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred hot to the ſick, whereas cold drinkes are more pleaſant, and more profitable to them that are ſick of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; for it is not ſo fitting to give to them that bee thirſty, hot and heating drinkes; and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> preſcribes cold water to temper the heat. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115445:89"/>in ſome diſeaſes I doe not diſlike this drink, ſo in acute and cholerick Feavers eſpecially, I think it not fit. But if at any time the by-ſtanders would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it to ſuch as are in Feavers, or the ſick themſelves deſire it, let the boyling milke, be coagulated either with the juice of Lemons, or a little vinegar, adding thereto a little ſugar; taken take away the curd, and ſo there remains the whey alone mixt with the acide juices, an excellent remedie to coole Feavers and to open obſtructions. As for the healthfull, they may uſe it prepared any way even as they pleaſe. Alſo if the milk be curdled with thinne beere or ſmall ale, it will not hurt the ſick, for it is of a cooling and opening quality, and may doe very much good to the body, for ſmall beere is of the ſame vertue with barley water, which <hi>Avicenne</hi> and others doe highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. I finde in <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> a darke manner of making a Poſſet,

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115445:90"/>and ſo the whey is ſeparated from that which is congealed into curd.</hi> Although now adayes ſo much art bee not uſed, yet the manner of preparing it is the ſame; for firſt the milk boyles up once or twice; then by powring thereinto Wine or Ale, there is made a ſeparation of the whey from the thicker ſubſtance;

                  <p>IT is confeſſed of all, that meats that are eaſie to be concocted, and of good juice, and quickly nouriſhing, ſhould be preſcribed for the ſick, and therefore very well are gellies, and reſtorative broths made for them.

                  <p>IT is uſuall with ſome to put gold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the broth of the ſick, eſpecially for them that are in conſumptions, which although I doe not hold to be hurtfull, or any way pernicious to them, yet I thinke it is altogether unprofitable. Touching the vertue of gold, there is indeed no ſmall controverſie among Phyſicians.
<note place="margin">The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of gold.</note> For many excellent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are of opinion, that it is good for the affects of the heart, to renew the ſight, to cure the palpitation, ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, leproſie, epilepſie, and being quenched in wine, to cure the paines of the ſpleene, to help thoſe that be melancholick, and to hinder putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

                     <hi>Avicenne</hi> ſaith, that in gold there are hidden qualities, which are good againſt poyſon; if a new borne child hold it in his mouth he need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feare the Devill; if a woman with child drinke it, ſhe ſhall not bring forth an abortive. But in his book <hi>de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. cordialibus,</hi> he places gold betwixt ſilver and the hyacinth, and he will have it to be of more vertue than ſilver, but
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115445:92"/>leſſe than the hyacinth. The filings of gold is an ingredient in the remedies againſt melancholly. But hee addes that ſilver is ſomewhat cold and dry,
<note place="margin">Of Silver.</note> and that the operation thereof is like to the hyacinth, ſave that it is weaker.
<note place="margin">Of the Hyacinth.</note> Now to the hyacinth he attributes the vertue of cheering and comforting the heart, and of reſiſting poyſon, which vertues (ſaith he) doth flow from the hyacinth, as the vertue of drawing i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron from the loadſtone; neither can gold be diſſolved and overcome by our heat, as vegetables are; for (ſaith he) the ſubſtance thereof doth not yeeld thereto, but only our naturall heat helps the penetrating quality thereof. <hi>Fernel</hi> himſelf highly commends it, in that it partakes not of the malignity that is in moſt mettals: Alſo <hi>Paracelſus</hi> contends that all diſeaſes, even the leproſie, and the gowt may be cured by the uſe of it: And them doe many moderne Phyſicians follow, and mixe gold in ſundry medicaments. But others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all theſe things; <hi>Antonius Muſa Braſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavolus, Andreas Baccius</hi> of Baths, <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, Eraſtus, Rondeletius, Duretus,</hi> and other excellent men. <hi>Savanarola</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolls aqua vitae above all gold, as being

                  <p>This controverſie I will not make mine in this place; for though gold may ſeeme to be an excellent cordiall, and a ſtrengthening medicament, though it be not hurtfull to ſeeth it in broths, yet it doth no good at all, for nothing is diſſolved from it, nor paſſes into the liquor, except ſome droſſe, becauſe of the ſubſtance, which is ſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, as it can bee diſſolved with no fire, with no boyling: Againe, it is not eaſily

Seeing then that thoſe that that are hectick doe not require to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115445:93"/>be corroborated in quality alone, but to bee repaired by a ſubſtantiall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, in vaine ſhall gold bee ſodden in their broths, for verily it cannot repaire the loſſe of radicall moyſture, ſeeing it it is not converted into ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is voyded as it was taken, or boyled, without any diminution of the weight. Yet all this doth not take from it the cordiall vertue which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is in it, to conquer poyſons, and melancholy diſeaſes, but only proves there is no vertue in it for nouriſhing.
<note place="margin">Gold nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes not.

<note place="margin">Small beer beſt for morning draughts.</note> purges the ſtomach (and as they ſay well) cleanſes it, tempers naturall heat, moyſtens the body, and which I think moſt true, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the generation of the ſtone; for it tempers and moyſtens the Kidneyes; as many of our ancient and moderne Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters preſcribe broths of Butter, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and other ſuch things for to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115445:96"/>the Kidneyes, why not by the like reaſon ſmall Beere, which doth coole, moyſten, and is diuretick. But yet ſingular heed is to be taken, that in the morning while the ſtomach is empty,
<note place="margin">The evill effects of ſtrong drink in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> ſtrong Ale, or other ſuch drinkes be not powred in, for they hurt the nervous parts, from whence the Gout, paine of the joints, inflammations of the bowels, and other grievous diſeaſes may ariſe; for by reaſon of their ſubtiltie, and great force of ſpirits, theſe drinkes do inſinuate themſelves into the nervous parts, inſomuch as they are uſually troubled with paine of the joints, that are eagerly delighted with ſuch drinks, and therefore adviſedly is wine forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them that are Gouty. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the diverſitie of natures is to bee conſidered here; for they that are of a temperament ſomewhat moyſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they need but little drinke, ought not to drink in the morning faſting. But they that are of a dry conſtitution both may, and ought to drink faſting, but not ſtrong drinks; for by them the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts are ſooner offended and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Galen</hi> confirms this in his Comment upon the 21. <hi>Aph. lib.</hi> 2. where he ſaith, that if before the uſe of meats, any man
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115445:97"/>uſe a liberall drinking of Wine, hee is very much troubled with Convulſions, and taken with Frenſies; and in his Comment upon the 20. <hi>Aphoriſme, lib.</hi> 6. Among the cauſes why ſo many are vexed with the Gout, and paine of the joints, he reckons this, that they drink ſtrong drinks before meat; <hi>for they do very ſoon offend the ſubſtance of the nerves, as doth carnall copulation.</hi> Alſo <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Sympoſiacks, diſputing whether new diſeaſes may breed or no, produces this as a cauſe of new diſeaſes, that they uſe to drinke ſtrong wines before they have eaten any meat. There is the ſame reaſon for ſtrong Beere or Ale, which may bring the ſame, yea greater evils. Therefore as I doe not diſlike the drinking of ſmall beere, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not fit for all, ſo I thinke men ſhould abſtaine from ſtrong drink, for fear of very many diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>THis likewiſe is the cuſtome of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that if at any time they eate meats of hard digeſtion, as are Veniſon,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115445:97"/>Beefe, Salt-fiſh; or that ſoon corrupt, as Summer-fruits, they preſently drink af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them ſtrong diſtilled waters, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae, Cinnamon water, Roſa ſolis, and other ſuch like, namely, to help con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. But that is not done without hazard of health; for ſeeing that the forenamed meats are not wont to bee concocted but by a long ſtay in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<note place="margin">The evill effects of ſtrong waters.</note> theſe waters being of a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and piercing quality, draw the meats downe into the veines, not yet fully concocted, from whence proceed cudities and obſtructions. Thus Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians doe well forbid to uſe diureticks with meat, or preſently after meat, leſt they carry the cruditie of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to the paſſages of the urine, and make the evill worſe. So likewiſe they forbid to uſe them, when there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vitious humours, or when ſome corrupt humour is lodged in the firſt paſſages, before that purging be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, otherwiſe there is feare leſt obſtructions in the paſſages of the urine, or in the bowels be either made or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                  <p>There is the ſame reaſon of waters, which they take to further concoction, for that great vertue of opening with
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115445:98"/>which they are endued. And this have many Phyſick authors obſerved: <hi>Ronde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letius</hi> in his Chapter of the Palſie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a water for the Palſie, which he will have taken into an empty belly. <hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which are very hot and attenuating ought to be taken with an empty, and firſt purged Stomach, and are not to be mixed with meats, for they would force the meats not yet concocted to goe down with them, and ſo would breed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</hi> And in the 31. Chapter hee tels a ſtory of two Phyſicians, whereof the firſt, <hi>when hee would have provoked the flowers with the uſe of opening and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating ſyrupes, hee brought the woman to a palſie, by reaſon that the crude and glutinous humours which were in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, by force of the Medicaments were drawne down to the parts, and lying upon the finews cauſed the Palſie. The other, while hee went about to cure the * pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,

Theſe ought not to be given immediately after nor before meat, becauſe by their heat and raritie, they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carry along with them the halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crude meat to the firſt paſſages: Hence it appeares that they erre that minister very hot powders after meat, which ought to be but moderately hot.</hi> Which counſell is alſo approved by others, to wit, that thoſe things which help concoction muſt goe before, not follow meat, as ſaith <hi>Riolanus, Gordonius</hi> in his <hi>praxis,</hi> and <hi>Fuchſius</hi> in his Chapter <hi>de Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>

Of the ſame opinion is <hi>Aetius,</hi> deſcribing remedies for crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Theſe men doe ſeeme indeed to feele ſome benefit thereby, as long as theſe waters doe heat the orifice of the ſtomack; but by reaſon of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their ſubſtance, they doe ſoon penetrate into the bowels, and increaſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115445:100"/>their diſtemper, whereby afterwards the pain growes greater, and the more they drink theſe waters, the more their their bellyes ſeem to bee refrigerated, and enfeebled. <hi>For thoſe things which doe heat too much, are ſo far from heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthning the ſtomack, as that they rather coole, by rarefying, or by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the inward heat from within to the circumference;</hi> as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſaith in his Chapter of palpitation. Therefore <hi>Mercatus</hi> counſels, that with exceeding great caution wee uſe the helps which further concoction, or diſcuſſe winde. For we are often deceived (ſaith hee) by windineſſe, and we are enforced to diſcuſſe it, not without the great hurt of the ſick. Theſe things are eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be obſerved of them that abound with hypochondriack windineſs, whoſe bowels doe boyle with heat, but ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks ſeeme to bee ſomewhat cold. Some perhaps will object that Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe preſcribe pepper groſſely beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; and <hi>Aetius</hi> commends the uſe of wormewood for this hypochondriack windineſſe.
<note place="margin">Groſs pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> But as <hi>Amatus</hi> the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, a moſt ſkilfull Phyſician, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, pepper groſſely beaten is good, becauſe it goes not to the bowels, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115445:100"/>only ſtrengthens the ſtomack, and ſo it heats not the liver. Againe, the heat thereof is extinguiſhed in the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and is ſoon diſperſed. Laſtly, it detergeth &amp; caſteth out ſharp humours.
<note place="margin">Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> Alſo wormewood is good, becauſe as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, it binds the ſtomack, it helpeth by its deterſion not againſt flegmatick, but aduſt cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which foment this diſeaſe, and purgeth them out by ſiege and urine.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Have often heard women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed complaine of a grievous thirſt, and heat, becauſe it is a maxime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by evill obſervation, that they may take no cooling thing, but only drinks actually and potentially hot, as burnt wine (which drink is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in England) brewed with hot ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cinnamon water, and the like (to wit) to ſtrengthen and comfort them, for ever the by-ſtanders are ſolicitous of thoſe ſtrengthning meats and drinks, as alſo that the cold may not hurt them, for by reaſon of cold, gripings in their
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115445:101"/>belly doe often happen, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the birth. But this is a very great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and often pernicious to women in Child-bed, but alwayes very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Now there are divers conditions of women in Child-bed, for ſome of in them a morbous preparative, and the ſickly humours being moved with the travaile of the birth, do bring forth in them divers diſeaſes; but others enjoying a more perfect health, doe quickly returne to themſelves, and by little and little grow well againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dangerous ſymptome: To the former, thoſe ſtrong and hot drinkes are very hurtfull, for they inflame the inward parts, and amend not the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous humours at all, but increaſe and corrupt them; And to the latter ſort, which otherwiſe would recover their health, they may cauſe feavers, and ſuch like diſeaſes. Now, although I doe not approve of very cold drinks, but rather would have them to bee ſomewhat warme, yet I cannot allow of hot drinks for the forenamed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. If there be a feaver, Phyſicians doe preſcribe altering and cooling ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupes, why not alſo cooling drinke?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115445:101"/>Therefore I have oftentimes permitted drink not ſo ſtrong, and ſomewhat cool, to women in Child-bed, burning and thirſting after ſmall beere, by which they have felt themſelves much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; much more will ſuch drinkes bee convenient for them if they bee in a feaver.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe they doe ill, who feed them with much meat, and very nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, for in the beginning their diet ſhould bee ſlender and ſparing, as in them that have been wounded, becauſe nature is weak, and not able to digeſt a great quantity of meat.

                  <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Two Errours about the choyſe of Nurſes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THoſe Gentlewomen that will not undergoe the trouble of nurſing their children themſelves, doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even by the advice of Phyſicians, (unleſſe neceſſity enforce them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) reject thoſe Nurſes whoſe milk is old, that is to ſay, which have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuck a long time, to wit, a yeare, or two: for they thinke that milke is not ſo wholſome for a new born child. And therefore they ſometimes preferre a Nurſe, although elder, which hath but lately given ſuck, before one that is young, if ſhe hath given ſuck longer. But I thinke they are in a great errour,
<note place="margin">The breaſt doth every day afford freſh and new milk.</note> who ſuppoſe any milk to be old, ſeeing that every day the breaſts of Nurſes doe afford new and freſh milke. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſuppoſe a Nurſe to be young, well behaved, of a good conſtitution, uſing a good and wholſome dyet, and abſtaining from venery, it matters not how long ſhe hath given ſuck. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the milke doth participate of the nature of its materiall and efficient cauſes, and is generated out of theſe cauſes only; if the Nurſe be healthfull,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115445:103"/>and free from care, anger, and ſorrow of minde, and feed on good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meats, there is no doubt but ſhe gives alwaies good and wholſome milk. For the milk doth partake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bloud of which it is made;
<note place="margin">Milk is made of bloud, I which if it be good, the milk cannot be bad.</note> but in a healthfull body, nouriſhed with wholſome meats, good bloud is alwaies made: And of good bloud is not wont to be made bad and unwholſome milk, if the body be in health. Nor can giving ſuck it ſelf alter or vitiate the milk, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as nature ordaines nothing that is evill, and it would be ill for the child, if every day the Nurſes milk were made worſe by giving of ſuck.
<note place="margin">It is not worſe for giving ſuck</note> Experience ſhewes in women of the meaner rank, who are not ſo curious in their choyce of Nurſes, that their children are as well fed, and as healthfull as others. When therefore occaſion is offered of chuſing a Nurſe, let only her conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, healthfulneſſe, and age be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if theſe be right, there is no doubt but uſing a commendable diet, ſhe ſhall alwayes give good and freſh milk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every day new milk is made, and hath the ſame cauſes of generation after five yeares, which it had the firſt moneth.</p>
                  <p>There is another Errour of ſome, no
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115445:103"/>leſſe ſuperſtitious than the former, and that not only of the people, but ſome Phyſicians alſo; namely, that they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautelous, even more than needs, in obſerving whether the Nurſe hath brought forth a male or a female, and they will have the Milke of her that hath borne a Male, to bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for nouriſhing a Female, and contrarywiſe the milk of her that hath brought forth a female, to be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the nurſing of a male, becauſe the milk of her which hath born a boy, is thought to bee hotter, and therefore more fit for a girle, which is thought to be of a colder temperament, becauſe it doth moderate her coldneſſe; and contrarywiſe, becauſe a male is hotter, the milke of her which hath borne a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, doth temper his heat.
<note place="margin">Some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are hotter then ſome men.</note> But theſe are all falſe.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Firſt</hi> they ſuppoſe amiſſe, that a female is alwayes colder than a male, when as indeed experience teſtifies, that ſome women are hotter than ſome men. Nor can a cholerick woman, without errour, bee thought to be colder than a flegmatick man, which I ſhall prove by divers reaſons in another place: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, although wee ſhould grant this, yet our opinion will ſtand ſtable and unſhaken.</p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:115445:104"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> they erre in ſuppoſing that the childs ſucking can change the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the milke.
<note place="margin">A childs ſucking cannot change the temper of the milk.</note> For ſeeing (as wee have ſaid) the nature of the milk doth follow the nature of the efficient cauſe, and of the meats of which it is made, what can the child do againſt theſe. For while it ſucks, it cannot by contact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone change the conſtitution of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the temper of the meats which ſhe eats. Perhaps ſome will think, that the child, ſo long as it is in the wombe, doth communicate its temperature to the mother, by heating her, if it bee a male, or cooling her, if a female. But that is very doubtfull, for a female ſhould alſo heat the mother, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are alwaies hotter than thoſe that are of riper age. But beſides, we know how hard a thing it is to change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſtitution, ſo as it can ſcarce by any long uſe of meats or medicines be ſo weakned, but it doth eaſily return to its priſtine condition. And we ſee the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when ſhee hath brought forth her child, doth retain her old temper of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and we can diſcern no footſteps of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new temperament which ſhe hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the child. And if there were any, it might nevertheleſſe be eaſily loſt in proceſſe of time, and by change of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115445:104"/>It is therefore the ſurer way to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature not of the childe which the nurſe hath born, but onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the nurſe her ſelfe, and the diet which ſhe uſes.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115445:111"/>this Colledge, wherein are the moſt excellent Phyſicians of Europe, doth leave free the uſe of Chymicks, ſo as the old manner of curing, according to the precepts of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> remaine in force. Indeed that art in <hi>Galens</hi> time was not practiſed nor knowne,
<note place="margin">Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry not known in <hi>Galens</hi> time.</note> nevertheleſſe it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee rejected. For it hath been, and ever will be free for poſterity, to adde ſomething for uſe and ornament, to an art already well eſtabliſhed. Thus we uſe many remedies which our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were ignorant of, as Sene, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, Caſſia, Tamarinds, and other things far better than peplium, coloquintida, and the like. Moreover, the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the chymicall art do appeare even in the vulgar preparation of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments: Now according to them, all remedies are prepared, either by addition, detraction, or immutation; for either the matter of the medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is required, or elſe the faculty and vertue ſeparate from the matter, the matter in thickning, aſtringent, and drying remedies; but the vertue alone in attenuating, diſſolving, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging medicines, becauſe the groſſeneſs of the matter hinders their efficacie. For
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115445:112"/>this intention <hi>Meſues</hi> makes 4 kinds of operation; decoction, diſſolution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, trituration, or grinding to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. What is infuſion but an extract begun? What is decoction, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roaſting with fire, but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of calcination? But in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſeparation which they ſo much wiſhed for, and the Ancients accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo neceſſary, the chymicall Art doth excell, for by divers wayes it ſevers the pure from the impure, and ſo extracts and ſtirs up the divers ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of medicaments, which otherwiſe had been hid under the groſſe matter, and could never have been drawn out by naturall heat, as eſpecially may be ſeen in minerals. Beſides, it concocts, and attenuates the earthly parts; alters, or elſe quite takes away the malignant, venemous, and corrupt qualities, and increaſes the vertues; for there is more vertue and efficacie in cinnamon water againſt the Syncope, and other diſeaſes, than in whole cinnamon. The ſame may be ſaid of diſtilled and extracted oyles; the oyle of thyme, brimſtone, or cloves, is more efficacious, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, than the ſimples out of which it hath been extracted. Againe, it makes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115445:112"/>many things to become more pleaſant, and familiar to Nature, and contracts many vertues into a ſmall lumpe; as in extracts, waters, diſtilled oyles, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kindes of ſalt, and ſuch like. Now ſeeing that it is the duty of a Phyſician to cure quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly, without doubt hee ſhall be able to doe it more compleatly, being well ſkilled in chymicall remedies, whoſe efficacy being greater doth ſooner work, whoſe ſmall doſe, and neatneſſe of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on help unto pleaſantneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome perhaps will object, the whole age of the Ancients wanted Chymicall remedies, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cured better than we doe, and it happens yet daily, that without them Phyſicians do perform many wonderfull cures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> That no man denies, ſo men in old time did feed on Acornes, and lived long, yet having found out the uſe of Corn, we reject Acornes and leave them for Hogs. But if the Ancients themſelves (the ancienteſt of whom was in his time a new Phyſician) had added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the inventions of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, we ſhould have all the Arts to be onely begun. Again, if they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115445:113"/>ſuch cures, yet they did them but ſlowly, and unpleaſantly. Therefore Chymicall operations were added for the ſolace of the ſick, honour and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Art, not that Phyſicians might cure abſolutely, but better and more commodiouſly. But there are ſome things which doe terrifie the ſick from the uſe of thoſe remedies. The firſt is, becauſe they think that all the remedies of the Chymiſts are very ſtrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, doe preſently either kill or cure, and are (as they call them) deſperate Medicines, that they do operate quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pleaſantly, but not ſafely, and that they leave behinde them a ſtain in the bowels, which can ſeldome or never afterwards be waſhed out. Now they think it better to bee cured ſlowly, ſo that they bee ſafely and ſurely cured: <hi>Soon enough</hi> (ſaith the Proverbe) <hi>if well enough.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sat citò, ſi bene ſat.</note> But theſe things have their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall from their ignorance of that art, and the audacitie of ſome knaves, who uſe onely the moſt violent, and ſuch as are prepared by a prepoſterous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for every chymicall preparation is not convenient for every remedy; we uſe <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> with good ſucceſs, but Mercury ſublimate, or precipitate,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115445:113"/>not without hazard of life. For the Chymiſts have many Medicines which are very gentle, and not at all violent. And indeed the Chymicall Apothecary and common likewiſe have the very ſame matter of Phyſick, out of vegetables, animals, minerals, and all other things as well gentle as violent which are uſed in Phyſick. But the chymicall preparation doth amend or quite take away what is hurtfull in the violent, and makes them more ſafe and pleaſant for mans uſe. Beſides the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have very many cordiall and ſtrengthning remedies, oftentimes much better than the vulgar. But many times diſeaſes doe require veryſtrong reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, reſiſting the force of the weaker Medicines: Yea <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Malo nodo malus cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus. Aph.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Meth. Cap.</hi> 15.</note> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and other of the Ancients did uſe ſtronger remedies than many Chymiſts doe; <hi>For unto deſperate diſeaſes themoſt forcible remedyes are to be applyed,</hi> was <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his counſell. And <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf blames <hi>Eriſiſtratus</hi> for uſing only milde and gentle remedies, which he wil have to bee hurtful in great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſes, in which if opportunity which is very ſpeedy be pretermitted, either the patient dies, or the diſeaſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115445:114"/>becomes incurable. It is therefore more ordinary with the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> to wit, thoſe Phyſicians that follow the old way, to uſe violent Medicines, which Chymiſts doe either better make uſe of, or at leaſt better prepared. Nor is it true, that the Chymiſts doe prepare all their remedies with the moſt violent heat of fire; for moſt commonly, a gentle heate is uſed. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> affirmes, that by a violent heat of fire many Druggs doe lay aſide all their acrimony and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And it is certaine, that by this <hi>ſpagiricall</hi> art, the moſt unruly medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made ſerviceable, and many that are otherwiſe poyſonous, their deadly qualities being corrected, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cordiall.</p>

                  <p>ANother cauſe why many are ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of theſe Chymicall remedies, is becauſe the Chymiſts are thought to uſe Mineralls. And indeed it is certain enough, that many that cloake their knaveries with the title of Chymiſts, doe often uſe Mineralls, both ill prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and wronge applyed. But as wee
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115445:114"/>have ſaid before, the matter and ſubject of operation is the ſame, of both the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries as well Chymicall as vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, nor doth the Chymiſt leſſe uſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables than the Galeniſt, and it is an eaſie thing for him to adminiſter vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables alone to his patients, if they doe much impugne Mineralls. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the uſe of Mineralls was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar among the ancient Phyſicians, before the invention of the chymicall art, than now it is: For I know many Chymiſts that ſeldome uſe them, but rather make choice of vegetables alone. But the writings of the Ancients doe teſtifie, that they were wont to uſe ſteele, burnt braſſe, the flower of braſs, and ſuch like, either not at all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or but very ſleightly. The flower of braſſe whole doth purge vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Some give it, ſaith <hi>Dioſcorides,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 5.</note> knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in dough, and made up in a pill. Burnt Braſſe (ſaith he) being drunke with honey and water, doth provoke vomit: the flower of Braſſe given in the weight of two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples drams out groſſe humours.</hi> Very many uſe the Armenian ſtone not prepared at all. Is not that art highly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, which, if at any time it uſe theſe things, doth exhibit them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115445:115"/>and elegantly prepared, not whole? <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> writes, that Silver is good againſt the poyſon of Wolves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane; and <hi>Avicenne</hi> will have it to bee excellent againſt the trembling of the heart. If therefore the authority of the Ancients be of any moment with us, it muſt not be imputed to Chymiſts as a fault, that ſometimes they make uſe of Mineralls, ſeeing they whom they call Galeniſts are guilty of the ſame errour, if it be one, but herein they are excelled by the Chymiſts, in that they prepare them better, inſomuch as they may bee adminiſtred with leſſe harme. <hi>Matthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in his fore named epiſtle, ſaies well, that great and chronicall diſeaſes can ſcarce be overcome without Mineralls, but thoſe Mineralls are not to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred without the knowledge of the Chymicall art. And the uſe of Bathes is ordinary, all which doe partake of the vertue of ſome Minerall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps ſome will object, that Mineralls are altogether poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and hurtfull to nature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought into action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Which although it be after a ſort true of many Mineralls, yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but they may be made good
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115445:115"/>remedies in ſtubborne diſeaſes, that ſtand in need of ſtrong Medicines, and it is the nature of all Medicaments, that they alter our body; for as we have ſaid, <hi>forcible remedies muſt bee applyed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame diſeaſes;</hi> hence ſometimes it comes to paſſe, that ſome Empyricks through their adventurous raſhneſſe do cure diſeaſes that are given over by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the diſgrace of Phyſicians. If therefore the Ancients without ſcruple or doubt did uſe them whole, how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate are our times, in which we are wont ſo curiouſly to prepare and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them, ſo as they may by our heat be more eaſily brought into action, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to confeſſe the truth, there are many of them, which doe not require any great labour to reduce them into action, as the flower of braſſe whole (as the Ancients did preſcribe it) though unaltered by our heat, doth neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe purge vehemently. <hi>Avicenne</hi> when he makes Gold a meane betwixt Silver and the Hyacinth, attributes to them the vertue of corroborating and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart, and of reſiſting poyſon, which vertues (ſaith he) doe flow from the Hyacinth, as the power of drawing Iron from the Loadſtone, and cannot
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115445:116"/>be diſſolved and overcome by our heat, as vegetables are; for that (ſaith hee) the ſubſtance thereof doth not endure, but onely naturall heate helps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the penetrating quality thereof: Therefore according to the judgement ef <hi>Avicenne</hi> it doth not appeare, that the Hyacinth or Gold, or Silver are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into action, or that they are changed and diſſolved by our heat. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there are many ſuch things which do help by contact alone, as <hi>Galen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Peione hung about the neck, and <hi>Monardes,</hi> the ſtone of Kidneyes bound to the arme, which help onely by the diffuſion of their quality like light; and many ſuch things have been obſerved by divers, which would bee too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to rehearſe. Moreover not onely Minerals, but alſo ſome vegetables are poyſonous, which nevertheleſſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably adminiſtred, at leaſt in ſuch a doſe,
<note place="margin">Mineral's may bee taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</note> as nature is able to reſiſt. Seeing then it is manifeſt that Mineralls are prepared by Chymiſts, and that the oyles, quinteſſences, and tinctures of them are extracted, it is alſo as true and manifeſt, that they may profitably, and without danger bee conquered by our heate, and taken inwardly.</p>

                  <p>ALthough I have already in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall allowed, and approved the Chymicall preparation of remedies, yet we muſt know, that not all remedies prepared chymically are good and wholſome, for many queſtionleſſe are badly prepared, which perhaps requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another kind of preparation; it will not therefore bee amiſſe to endeavour to repell and root out that ſelfe-love, through which they extoll their owne medicines with innumerable commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and preferre them before all others. For they are not ſparing in promiſing great things, going about to perſwade us that they will work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and they forcibly obtrude reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies on us, which (if they may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited) are good for all ſorts of feavers, and doe cure divers kinds of diſeaſes, which even contrary cauſes have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Which of them doth not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend the diſſolving of gold,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> a deceit.</note> which they call. <hi>Anrum potabile,</hi> teach, extoll, and admire the divers wayes of making it? Verily, if all the wayes of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115445:117"/>preparing this one remedy were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe together, it would make a large, and full volume, and yet they are all fabulous, and meere deceits; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe for all this, they doe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly and impudently brag of the efficacie of that not yet invented reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The ſame may be ſaid of other remedies much more eaſie, for they ſet forth many things for tinctures, oyles, ſalt, and the like, which are nothing leſſe then what they avouch them to be, as might bee manifeſted of many things in particular, but ſo this tractate would be too long and tedious. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe let us heare their reaſons, which we have touched in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we will here briefly repeat them. The vulgar, or common Medicines (ſay they) are uſually poyſonous, as are almoſt all Catharticks, or purging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and very many altering me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as ſaffron, hemlock, coriander, if they be taken in too great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But the Chymicall are altogether free from any poyſonous quality, and from all impurity, which may weaken the force of the remedies; whereas in the vulgar this ſame impurity doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, which is no more amended by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115445:117"/>the mixture of other things, then if birds ſhould be boyled with their neſts, guts, dung and all, only a little cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and ſugar added thereunto. So pils, electuaries, lozenges, opiats, have in them as well hurtfull as profitable qualities; wherefore they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly bee brought into action by our heat. But in chymicall remedies, the noxious qualities are ſevered from the wholſome, and ſo they are more eaſily brought into action, and are of greater efficacie and certainty. Honey and ſugar, which are ingredients in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers remedies, becauſe they are of quick ſpirits, and abound with ſharp, and filthy vapours, are ill mixed therewith. In like manner they like not decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe thereby many of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are loſt, the remedies become of an unpleaſant relliſh, and the efficacie is dulled by the mixture of a ſtrange liquor. Thus they commend their own remedies, for their purity, ſafety, efficacie, pleaſant relliſh, and ſmall doſe. And indeed this is true in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many of them, eſpecially mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, yet not alwayes in all.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> they falſly ſuppoſe that they have all ſome venomous quality
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115445:118"/>in them, for they doe ill to call that poyſon, which is only ſomewhat groſs in ſubſtance. For there is ſcarce any mixt body which is not heterogeneall, and conſiſts not of divers parts, every one of which ſeverally have in them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wholſome and profitable vertues, as the chymicall reſolution it ſelfe doth demonſtrate. We muſt confeſſe, that many things that are poyſonous, are by the chymicall art made harmleſſe: But forthwith to call that hurtfull and poyſonous, which is, or ſeemes to bee leſſe pure, is too much raſhneſſe, ſeeing that the mixture of divers parts is not made without the ſpeciall providence of nature. This doe meats and drinks ſhew, in which God hath not without cauſe mingled the wholſome part with the unwholſome, for the good of mans body. Do not we more commodiouſly uſe wine, than the ſpirit of wine, the ordinary drinking of which doth rather harm than good, whereas wine it ſelf doth yield a profitable, pleaſant, and comfortable drink to the body? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ſaid well, they that doe ſo much diſlike the earthy parts, ſhould be nouriſhed with nothing but ſpirits, as the ſpirit of wine, oyle of corne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115445:118"/>of fleſh. Not that I deny pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to be needfull, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a chymicall preparation. So we prepare wheat for the making of bread, by grinding, fifting, kneading, baking: and fleſh, by waſhing, and boyling; which if they ſhould be chymically prepared, would become hurtfull, and utterly loſt. Wherefore is the ſeparative faculty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the body, but for the ſeparation of thoſe things that are unprofitable? And therefore <hi>Faber,</hi> a late writer, one that makes large promiſes,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fabers</hi> Errour taxed.</note> after the manner of the Chymiſts, ſeems to me to be injurious to the God of nature, in ſaying that the mixture of pure, and unpure, that is to ſay, of different parts in one and the ſame mixt body, doth proceed from the Creators curſe for ſinne. As though if man had never ſinned, God had created onely ſpirits, and not corporeall ſubſtances; oyle of cinnamon, and not cinnamon, which is an abſurd thing to ſuppoſe. And therefore he doth falſly define a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament to be a purity of nature, which doth by altering help and ſuccour our nature, when it is violated and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a diſeaſe, and hee will have only that which is pure, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115445:119"/>mixture, to be a medicament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that alone is capable of action, and efficacie. O fine pate! Are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies compounded out of the droſſe of things, excrements, dregs, things of leaſt reckoning, out of uſe, and in a manner nothing worth? Who ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the power of working, and of altering the body, even to thoſe excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious parts? which of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts doth not make uſe of excrements for Medicine? Verily there is no part of the drugs, which hath not in it ſome vertues wholſome for mans body, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for externall, or internall uſes. But let us look back to our own taſk. Not only in aliments is this mixture of groſs and ſubtile parts profitable, but in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments likewiſe. Wee often give Rubarb with good ſucceſſe to purge, but powdered, this is a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; but more commonly we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it being infuſed, when we do not ſtand in need of the groſſer part, for the vertue thereof is kept in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: But in the extract, which is a Chymicall invention, and is exceeding profitable in many things, part of the vertue is exhaled. Therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Galeniſts, is better than
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115445:119"/>the extract of the Chymiſts. Prepare Rubarb chymically, by diſtilling, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſalt, and extracting the ſpirits, and it will then be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, all the vertue of purging will periſh quite, although the Chymiſts will have the ſalt thereof to bee cathartick likewiſe. Moreover, as we ſaid in the firſt Chapter, in thickning, binding, corroborating, and drying medicines, the matter and ſubſtance is requiſite; thus experience ſhewes, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, preſerves, and powders of the Galeniſts, are oftentimes more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, than the oyles and ſpirits of the Chymiſts, for there is often need of whole medicaments, nor ought all things to be chymically prepared. And therefore many times the Chymiſts are forced to cloth thoſe their medicaments with another body, which but a little before they had ſeparated from their owne; for who dares taſte of oyles of Origanum, Brimſtone, Vitrioll, by themſelves, without mixing them with another liquor; and therefore they adde theſe ſame to opiats, lozenges julips, apozemes, in a very little doſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would ſcarce worke without a great deale of danger and harme to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115445:120"/>the body; for that part which firſt they ſhould but touch, they would alter not without apparent hurt. Therefore not every ſeparation of the groſſe parts from the ſubtile is wholeſome for the body, but ſometimes pernitious and deadly. Wherefore there is no reaſon, that for this cauſe the Chymiſts ſhould preferre their own, except in ſome few Medicaments, nor is there the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the whole, that is in the diſſolved parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they do not only deceive the people, but perhaps themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, while they ſo commend the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the groſſe parts from the thinne, and the ſecurity of their own remedies; for the noxious part is not alwaies ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the other in a chymicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, but is many times increaſed, whiles that it being all contracted into a little bulk, doth worke more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Let I pray all the purging extracts, and the other chymicall preparations of purging Medicines be duely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether any of them bee voyd of danger; yea they are oftentimes worſe, although by ſuch preparations they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times loſe their own ſtrength for the noxious qualitie is not alwaies in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115445:120"/>the thick ſubſtance, but oftentimes in that thinne ſubſtance which is extracted. The Trochiſks <hi>Alhandal</hi> doe purge ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, the extract is as hurtfull, and the ſediment which remaines from the extract, doth looſe in a manner all the noxious qualitie of the Colliquintida, becauſe this together with the purging qualitie goes all into that liquour, out of which the vertue is extracted, which, as uſually they do in other things, they call by a fond name <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Chymiſts doe no leſſe uſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives with thoſe extracts, than the <hi>Galeniſts.</hi> Admirable with them is the extract of Opium called <hi>Landamum,</hi> the Opium being prepared with divers mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to correct it, which, after they have uſed all their art in preparing and changing it, they dare not yet adminiſter without correctives, as they call them. Whether then hath this chymicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration taken away the violence from the catharticks, and the noxious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Opium or no?</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pleaſant reliſh, theſe do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompany Chymicall Medicines. We will exemplifie in purging extracts, and other things which are exhibited in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115445:121"/>a large Doſe, and are no leſſe unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, for the purging quality is a little exhaled. If ſome things by their too great quantity be noxious, they have it common with all meats, yea and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, though chymically prepared: neither if ſtrong Catharticks be hurtfull, are they therefore to be rejected, ſeeing that all remedies if they be ill uſed may doe harme. Therefore chymicall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are not alwaies the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, the extracts of Colliquintida, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, and Aloes, are no leſſe bitter and unpleaſant, then they are whole, and yet they are adminiſtred in a greater Doſe, yea if a Drugge have an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant reliſh, it can ſcarce be taken away without loſſe of the ſtrength. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the bitterneſſe from Aloes and Wormwood, and you take away their vertue. What I pray is the extract of Rubarb, but the infuſion of it vitiated; for when the infuſion is by a gentle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, brought to the conſiſtence of an extract, the ſubtile parts, in which is contained the purging vertue, doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate, inſomuch that the infuſion of two Drammes of Rubarb will purge better than the extract of four Drams. Thus the juice of Roſes purgeth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115445:121"/>the diſtilled water not at all. The extract of Coloquintida is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bitter, although it be a chymicall preparative, and notwithſtanding that it is adminiſtred in a greater doſe than the Trochiſks of Coloquintida called <hi>Alhandal.</hi> And indeed in reſpect of cathartick vegetables, the chymicall preparation muſt give place to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common, but in purging Mineralls, eſpecially thoſe that provoke vomit, the chymicall hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
<note place="margin">The ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirious.</note> Now the ſmalneſſe of the doſe alone, whereof the Chymiſts make great bragges, ought many times to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſeeing it is not alwaies requiſite, and argues a certaine venomous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or at leaſt not ſo benigne, as appears in the aforeſaid oyles of Vitriol, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Gloves, Origan, and other ſuch like, which whether they may be taken alone without any danger, or no, they ſhall be able to teſtifie, who like fooles are deſirous to make experiment; and therefore they adminiſter but a few drops of them, diſſolved in other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It is better therefore to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſome things in a larger doſe with their own ſubſtance, than their ſpirits in the leaſt quantitie, although in many
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115445:122"/>things, we do not diſlike the contracting of good vertues into a ſmall body, ſo as it bee uſed with right reaſon, to wit, thoſe things being obſerved which the Medicinall art of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>In the next place they diſallow of decoction, becauſe much of the ſtrength doth periſh thereby, the unpleaſant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes remaine, and the vertues are dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by reaſon of the mixture of a ſtrange moyſture. But firſt, the inconvenience will bee avoided, if the decoction bee made in a double veſſell, that the ſpirits evaporate not; as for the reliſh, they themſelves do more correct it than the Galeniſts doe; and in like manner they uſe water as a vehicle to the ſpirits. Now it is certain that decoctions are many times farre better than diſtilled waters, and extracts, becauſe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſimples paſſeth into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, without altering of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all.
<note place="margin">The deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Aniſe good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the colick.</note> Thus <hi>Heurnius</hi> obſerves; that he did more ſucceſſefully cure the pain of the Colick with the decoction of Aniſe, than with the ſpirit or oyle of it. The ſame thing have I alſo often obſerved, the reaſon whereof may bee this, becauſe the Decoction drinks the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115445:122"/>vertue of the Aniſe into every part of it, whereas three or foure drops of the Oyle doe moſt vehemently affect the part which they firſt touch, but do not diffuſe their vertue any further, neither if they be adminiſtred in broth, or any other liquor can they bee throughly mixed therewith. The temperature of many things is ſometimes loſt by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelfe doth often confeſſe as much, yea that ſomethings which in ſubſtance may ſafely be taken, by diſtilling do become hurtfull, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which (ſaith he) being thrice diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led turns to poyſon.</p>
                  <p>We infuſe Medicaments, when wee ſtand in need of the ſubtile parts, but if there be no need of them, then they are adminiſtred either whole or prepared ſome other way, neither are infuſions made in water onely, but in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liquours alſo. They ſeem alſo too much to feare the addition of honey and ſugar, becauſe (ſay they) they have venomous and deadly ſpirits. <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> averres it of honey thrice ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But being taken whole, they doe not ſend forth ſuch noxious ſpirits, wherby we know that the ſeparations of Nature and the Chymiſts are not alike:
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115445:123"/>Who would believe that the hot ſpirit of Wheat can be drawn out by our heat, as it is by Art? Nature of meats doth create chyle, blood, choler, but Art ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, oyles, and quinteſſences, which do very much differ from the nature and temperature of their matter. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore I do not think that the operations of nature, and the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical art are not alike, yet it is ſufficient if thoſe things which do reſult from the chymicall operation, be made conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for mans body, to withſtand the diſeaſes of it; and that art in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is praiſe worthy, which in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature doth ſo diverſly change bodies for the uſe of man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt from what hath been already ſaid, that chymicall remedies are not alwaies to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the other. Now though the Galeniſts doe juſtly refuſe the doctrine, of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> yet they doe not diſallow of chymicall remedies, but leave them their own place in Phyſick. And the Chymiſts themſelves cannot be without remedies prepared after the vulgar way,
<note place="margin">Chymiſts are not without vulgar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</note> as is evident in <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetanus,</hi> and others, yea and <hi>Paracelſus</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115445:123"/>himſelf, who preſcribes many decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and infuſions, and uſes many things whole, not changed at all by any chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall art. Therefore to both of them their own praiſe is due; for ſometimes there is need of uſing chymicall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſometimes, yea, very often the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Moſt indifferent therefore are the Galeniſts, who do not reject chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical remedies, but the Chymiſts are blame worthy, in that they never uſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their own, whereby it comes to paſſe, that oftentimes they promiſe wonders, which as experience ſhewes they are not able to perform. It is a ſign of an unſkilfull man alwaies to uſe Quinteſſences. Frankincenſe being whole cures wounds, which can never be cured with the oyle therof. Conſerve of Roſes performs that in corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and binding, which the ſpirit, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſalt thereof ſhall never be able to do; for diſtilled oyles; and ſharp Spirits do violently and ſpeedily aſſaile naturall heat. Therefore in regard of divers circumſtances, ſometimes a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and extract is to be uſed, ſometimes a Conſerve, Electuary, and Decoction. For all remedies doe not need a chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call preparation, many thereby being
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115445:124"/>utterly annihilated. Now ſome things cannot conveniently bee uſed, except they bee chymically prepared, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mineralls, and ſome things perhaps are prepared after one manner, which ought not to have beene prapared after another.
<note place="margin">An errour in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then in the other.</note> In generall it is to bee noted in Chymicall remedies, if at any time there be an errour, it is more dangerous then in the common medicines. Which things have beene ſaid not in diſgrace and contempt of the <hi>ſpagiricall</hi> art, but becauſe of empiricks &amp; others, who too adventurouſly, and without judgement miniſter remedies, which they take out out of lying bookes, and if ſomething hath beene chymically prepared, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps badly enough, they highly commend and admire the ſame.</p>

For as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies well in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, it is a point of ſound diſcretion, not to receede from thoſe things, which have ſeemed to bee right. As water drops are a long time in penetrating a ſtone; ſo in diſeaſes that are crude, and hard to bee concocted, if a man have once found out what is needfull to bee done, he ought not to recoile from it. That Phyſitian goes wiſely to worke, who having fully found out the diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks, and prognoſticks of a diſeaſe, doth apply remedies convenient in quantity, time, manner, and place. But if he bee miſtaken in the knowledge of the diſeaſe, as ſometimes it happens, it
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115445:125"/>is lawfull to change not onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but alſo the Phyſitian himſelfe, or at leaſt to call another to him, that conſulting together, they may diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeke out the nature of the diſeaſe, which when they have well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly found out, the patient commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to them, ought to hold on in the uſe of remedies.
<note place="margin">How to know when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are to bee charged</note> Now that hee may know when the remedies are to be changed, this is to bee noted. <hi>Firſt,</hi> if the remedies that have beene admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> doe helpe a little, it is a ſigne that that the nature of the diſeaſe was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly knowne, and thoſe muſt not be changed; for Phyſitians doe gather the ſignes of diſeaſes even from thoſe things which doe good, and harme. <hi>Cures</hi> (ſaith Hippocrates) <hi>doe ſhew the natures of diſeaſes. Cornelius Celſus</hi> in the beginning of his third book ſaith that, <hi>in acute diſeaſes, remedies that helpe not ought preſently to be changed, but in long diſeaſes</hi> (of which wee ſpeake in this chapter) <hi>not ſo:</hi> for wee muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſo long in the uſe of remedies, untill their operation being often fruſtrate, we perceive that the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was not well knowne.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if by the adminiſtration of the remedies
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115445:125"/>the ſymptomes be exaſperated, it is a ſigne they were contrary to the diſeaſe, and are therefore to be changed, to wit, in cronicall diſeaſes, for in acute diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if the exaſperation of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes doe happen with ſignes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, it is a token of a diſeaſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a criſis. Thus <hi>Antonius Muſa</hi> Phyſitian to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> when hee perceived the paine of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſtomack to become worſe by the uſe of hot things, he applyed cold remedies, and ſo cured him.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                     </label> remedies by daily uſe doe become at length familiar to nature, and ſo are unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> the remedies may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and their quantitie, but not the manner of curing, ſo long as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe remaines the ſame, and yeelds the ſame indications; for if the diſeaſe it ſelfe be changed, as if of a Tertian bee made a Quartane, or the patient become weaker, or there be a flitting of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from one part unto another, or the like, not onely the remedie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the method of curing ought to bee changed. Therefore I thought good to annex this chapter, becauſe it often falls out, that the patient, which hath
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115445:126"/>uſed perhaps a good Phyſitian, if the ſucceſſe which he expects doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follow, abjuring the Phyſitian, conſults with empiricks and ſilly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Now thoſe medicine-mongers do after the manner of the <hi>Andabatie</hi> (that is to ſay blindfold at adventure) fight with diſeaſes, try divers remedies, and never hold on in the uſe of that, in which they ſhould have perſiſted. U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually the laſt remedie is applauded, &amp; thoſe that went before are of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the people, as letting of blood, purgation, alteration, and the like, which notwithſtanding ſubdued the greateſt part of the diſeaſe. It falls out alſo many times, that the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an himſelfe being overcome with the importunity, &amp; complaints both of the ſicke and the by-ſtanders, is forced to make too much haſt with his remedies, and contrary to reaſon to change them: wherefore thoſe that be ſick ought pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to wait for the time of the cure, which cannot bee the ſame in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115445:129"/>in which every mans life is proffered to be ſold to him; then preſently compoſitions, and unutterable mixtures are provided, Arabia and India are brought in for aid, and for a little ulcer, Phyſick is fetched from the red Sea, when every poore man eates dayly to his ſupper the right reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> But that could never yet be brought to perfection, nor hath ever any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been ſo happy, that it could be ſufficiently furniſhed with its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<note place="margin">India ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furniſhed with its own reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> except the Indians. For ſeeing that the ſame things doe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grow in diverſe Countryes, it is certaine that they cannot every where be of the ſame vertue and goodneſſe. It is therefore lawfull to fetch them out of thoſe Countryes where the beſt doe grow, for the vertue of plants doth vary according to the nature of the places. The Arabians ſay, that ſome plants are hot in the third degree, which the Grecians will have to bee hot but in the ſecond, the Germanes in the firſt. Wherfore <hi>Galen,</hi> who lived in a moſt temperate Climate, did not think his own Country remedies to be ſufficient, but received Lemnian earth out of the Iſle <hi>Lemnos,</hi> approved of Candy dittander, Macedonian parſly,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115445:129"/>and ſuch like. And in purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, it is moſt manifeſt, for they doe not grow at home, but it is neceſſary that they bee brought from forraine Countryes, as Sene, Rubarb, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, ſome whereof being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, although with good dreſſing they be made to grow in our Gardens, yet not without a manifeſt waſting of their ſtrength, nor in that plenty which may be ſufficient for the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Thus we dayly uſe ſugar, pepper, ſpices, wine, which are ſupplyed unto us from other Countries. The <hi>Lybian Iris</hi> (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) doth differ as much from the <hi>Illyrian,</hi> as a dead body from a living, no ſmell at all proceeding from the <hi>Lybian,</hi> but the <hi>Illyrian</hi> yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a very pleaſant ſavour. God would not that every Country ſhould abound with all things, nor alwayes, that humane ſociety might bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. For as in every Country, one City ſupplies neceſſaries to another, ſo one Country to another. If one City doe ſtand in need of the help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why ſhall not one Country ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of another? But they think that thoſe remedies which grow at home, have a greater affinity with
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115445:130"/>the temperature of the Inhabitants, than the other. But experience ſhewes that we doe uſe profitably, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt, wine, and ſpices that are brought from abroad. Again, Phyſick is not agreeable to nature, but after a ſort contrary, becauſe it alters nature, and therefore it is neceſſary for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to uſe thoſe remedies which can moſt fitly performe it; and ſeeing that the ſame medicament, even in the ſame Country, doth changes it vertues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſituation, and nature of the places, it ought to bee gathered there where the beſt grows, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſometimes to bee fetched from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countryes. But if this can be done with equall commoditie, let the home-growing remedies be alwayes preferred before the forrain.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">53. <hi>Aph. lib.</hi> 7.</note> Yet ſome are ſo timorous and fearfull, that though they ſtand in need of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, yet they refrain to uſe them, leſt they accuſtome themſelves thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For they think that if they ſhould uſe them once or twice, and afterward leave off,
<note place="margin">A groſſe Errour.</note> they muſt either of neceſſity be ſick, or not be in ſound health, whoſe Errour it is my purpoſe in this place to declare, although ſome Phyſicians have been alſo of the ſame opinion, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any man adventurouſly to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome himſelf to ſuch great remedies, as letting of blood, and purging, leſt by intermitting or leaving off that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, he fall into dangerous diſeaſes. But herein they are miſtaken; for it is an Axiome of Phyſicians; <hi>One thing is indicated or betokened by one.</hi> And cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome it ſelf doth not properly indicate any thing, but together with other ſignes it indicates ſomewhat; for it hath reference to nature, being alſo called a ſecond nature; whatſoever indicates
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115445:131"/>any thing, doth indicate either the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or removeall of it ſelfe; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation if it be according to nature, and removeall if it be beſides nature, as a diſeaſe, and the cauſe of a diſeaſe. Seeing then only the cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe doth indicate evacuation, either by blood-letting, or by purging, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that cuſtome ſhould indicate and betoken theſe remedies, becauſe (as we ſaid) it hath reference to nature, but one and the ſame remedie cannot be betokened by diverſe things. If in any man abundance of blood, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch cauſe require blood-letting, leſt he fall into ſome grievous diſeaſe, Nature will not neceſſarily the next year require the ſame remedy, unleſſe he labour with the ſame diſeaſe, unto which nature cuſtome hath reference, becauſe only the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and not nature doth indicate this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. If therefore he muſt be let blood againe, it is in reſpect of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, not becauſe of cuſtome. Nor doth it follow, if this year <hi>Socrates</hi> his blood be ſo faulty, that there is need of evacuation, that there ſhall be the like faultines the next Spring; for both the temper of the man, and of the aire, and his manner of diet may be changed:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115445:131"/>Otherwiſe diſeaſes ſhould never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, if he that hath been once abundantly vacuated, muſt neceſſarily relapſe into the ſame diſeaſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cuſtome it ſelf doth not urge unto a reapplication of a remedy, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame, becauſe accuſtomed eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations are leſſe hurtfull, and they that are accuſtomed to it may more boldly admit of evacuation. Thus cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alone makes nothing unto future evacuations, unleſſe there be the cauſe of a diſeaſe with it; but if ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes uſe to return every yeare, as the Gout, pain of the joints, melancholy, and the like; becauſe the cauſes of theſe diſeaſes do lurk in the body, it is very good to prevent them with convenient remedies, (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith he did, in his Comment upon the forenamed Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme) which remedies are convenient to be applyed, not for aſſuefaction and cuſtome, but in reſpect of the cauſes of the diſeaſe, which, ſo often as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ought to be corrected with ſuch remedies. But all diſeaſes are not of that nature, that there is eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them every year, and therefore there is no fear of accuſtoming a mans ſelf to Phyſick, except the diſeaſe alſo
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115445:132"/>be made accuſtomary and familiar. The remedy that cures the diſeaſe, is not the cauſe of the return of the diſeaſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which it ſhould be, if uſe ſhould inforce a neceſſity of the remedie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only the cauſe of the diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires evacuation; from whence it would neceſſarily follow, that the uſe of evacuation doth afterward encreaſe the cauſe of the diſeaſe unto the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the like remedy.</p>

                  <p>IT is an uſuall thing with many in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Phyſick, to obſerve the Signes, to wit, whether the Moon be in this or that Signe, which is thought to governe this or that part.

<note place="margin">4. <hi>Fen. lib.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Some do advertiſe</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenne) <hi>that Cupping-glaſſes be not apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beginning of the moneth, becauſe the humours are not yet ſwelled up to the height, nor in the end of the moneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115445:132"/>then the humours are leſſened, but in the middle of the moneth, when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are in their height, following the increaſe of the Moon, at which time alſo the braine is increaſed in the Skull, and water in the rivers that ebbe and flow:</hi> Which his interpreters do referre to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great evacuations, during the ſame cauſe. And here two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be weighed, the one of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> the other of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers. Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de aëre, aquis, &amp; locis,</hi> adviſes to obſerve the great changes of times and ſeaſons, and the Solſtices, that we neither adminiſter Phyſick in them, nor Cauterize the parts about the belly, nor make any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, till at leaſt ten daies after. Now by thoſe great Changes, he underſtands the variations of heat and cold, which happen at the Solſtices, Equinoctials, under the Dogge-ſtarre, and before the Dogge-ſtarre, and at the riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome Conſtellations. For hee addes, <hi>Both the Solſtices are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but eſpecially the Summer Solſtice; ſo both the Equinoctialls are perillous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that in Autumne; the riſing of the Starres are alſo to be obſerved, principally the riſing of the Dogge-ſtarre, Arcturus,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115445:133"/>and the ſetting of the Pleiades:</hi> Becauſe at thoſe times diſeaſes do either end, or elſe are changed. Theſe things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the opinion of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> are to be known, in reſpect of the ſudden changes of the aire, which are wont to happen at the riſing of ſome Starres. Some to the forenamed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations do adde the Moon, which hath great dominion over theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things, and experience ſhewes that it hath much ſoveraigntie over the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the body, and * <hi>Galen</hi> alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the ſame. But Aſtrologers have gone further; for they attribute the ſignes of the Zodiack to the ſeverall parts of the body, and when the Sun and Moon are in thoſe ſignes, they hold it a dangerous thing to uſe remedies which concern thoſe parts, over which thoſe ſignes are thought to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and the common people in reading of Almanacks which come forth every yeare, are very cautelous in obſerving them, whereof wee will treat more at large in the following Chapter. But if all theſe obſervations of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> be true, there will ſcarce any time remain for adminiſtring Phyſick; for in both the Equinoctialls, Solſtices,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115445:133"/>at the riſing and ſetting of <hi>Arcturus</hi> and the <hi>Pleiades</hi> we muſt forbear ten daies, and before and under the Dogge-ſtar at leaſt forty daies; ſo likewiſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Aſtrologers we muſt abſtaine from Phyſick in all the Oppoſitions, Conjunctions, and Quartile aſpects of the Moon: All which if they ſhould be ſuperſtitiouſly obſerved, there would be no time left for Phyſick, although we neglect thoſe Starres whoſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not yet obſerved; ſome of which may perhaps hurt as much as the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Starres are not to be conſidered in the curing of diſeaſes, as they are in the Firmament, but for their influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe alterations which they make in the Aire; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forbids purging under the Dog-ſtar, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the heat of the Aire. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe whatſoever the alteration of the Aire be, the ſame cannot be equally good, nor alike bad to all, for evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to ſome it will do good, to others harm, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtitutions of men, nor was there ever ſuch a temper of the Aire and Weather, which was not more or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115445:134"/>leſſe healthfull, or hurtfull to ſome. <hi>For ſome Natures in Summer,

<note place="margin">3. <hi>Aph. lib.</hi> 3.</note> and ſo are ſome ages according to times, places, and manner of diet,</hi> becauſe the influences of the Stars, which evermore are univerſall, do act after the ſame manner only, and do hurt to ſome, and good to others, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature of diſeaſes and the patients, as alſo according to their age, country, time of the year, and other ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which do limit the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of univerſall cauſes. Again, the concourſe of the Stars is only a proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick and univerſall cauſe, which moves and ſtirs up the internall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Now theſe are known by their proper ſignes. Nor is there any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to conſider the ſtars, but only the motions of inward cauſes, which make the times of diſeaſes. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſtrologers, they do with a vain conceit attribute all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the ſtars, to wit, to the Planets, and the ſignes of the Zodiack. And becauſe the Planets, and the ſignes of the Zodiack have not one and the ſame
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115445:134"/>motion, ſome of the Planets having a ſwift, others of them a very ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Signes, the ſame motion alwaies equall, it will ſeldome happen that the Planets concurre with the Signe that is referred to the ſame part. For the Moon runs through all the ſignes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moneth, and therefore is often conjoyned with them all: But <hi>Saturne</hi> which they ſet over the Spleen, doth very ſeldome meet with the ſigne that is dedicated to the ſame part. The Stars therefore which are ſaid to have dominion over the ſeverall parts of the body, have influence either into the ſubſtance, or into the conformation of the parts; but not into the ſubſtance, becauſe there is no organicall part in the body, which is not made up of ſundry parts, which are of a diverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the hands and feet conſiſt of bones, nerves, arteries, muſcles, which cannot be equally ſubject to this or that Star. And ſeeing the like parts for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are in the other organes likewiſe, as bones in the feet, hands, breaſt, head, why ſhall not one and the ſame Starre bear rule over them all? It remaines then that they have influence into the conformation onely, which is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115445:135"/>to all the parts, for every part ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally may be without the ſame confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as bones may be as well croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as ſtreight, and be well nouriſhed too. The conformation of every part depends on number, magnitude, ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and figure. The influence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee made into the number of the parts, becauſe number in reſpect of it ſelfe, is not <hi>ens reale,</hi> that is, hath no reall exiſtence, as alſo becauſe one particle being added or taken away, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the part, is not thereby chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as if one finger of the hand bee wanting, the influence ceaſes not. In like manner not into the magnitude, for then the influence into an infant ſhould differ from that into one that is grown up to ripe age: not into the ſcituation, becauſe ſo the ſcituation being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the influence ſhould alſo be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as into the hand ſtretched out, and laid upon the head, or on the feet. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not in the figure it ſelfe, becauſe in like manner the figure being changed, the force and efficacie of the ſignes into the part is ſtill the ſame. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that the attribution of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and dominion to them over one part rather than another, is nothing elſe then
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115445:135"/>an idle fiction. But if any ſuch thing be granted, it is likely that that ſame influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will extend it ſelfe onely to thoſe parts, which have their proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance diſtinct from the reſt, as the Heart, the Brain, the Liver, &amp;c. and not to the Hands, and the Feet, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like parts, whoſe ſimilar parts are the ſame for ſubſtance, and differ only in conformation. In very deed, many Phyſicians ſeem to have given but little regard to thoſe Aſtrologicall obſervations. I have ſeen many ſick in the Solſtices and Equinoctials, to whom the forenamed remedies were applyed with good ſucceſſe, which if they had been omitted, peradventure the ſick had died. And therefore in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as the Apoplexie, Squinancie, Pleuriſie, burning Feaver, and the like, it is very dangerous to omit, or deferre neceſſary remedies for the diſpoſition of the Heavens, but wee ought rather to have regard to the times of diſeaſes, and natures working, and according to that obſervation, preſcribe ſometimes one, ſometimes another remedy, as at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times the diſeaſe requires. But when a Phyſician preſcribes Purging or Blooding, only for prevention of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115445:136"/>he may obſerve the four quarters of the Moon, and uſe the forenamed reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies rather in the firſt, than in the laſt Quarters, becauſe the Moon having a manifeſt power over the humours, when it increaſes they are augmented, and it decreaſing, they are diminiſhed. In like manner he may avoyd the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctials and Solſtices. But in the ſick, theſe cannot be obſerved without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſeeing that diſeaſes do not permit ſuch great delaies. But the figments of Aſtrologers, touching the dominion of the ſignes over all the parts of the body, are altogether to be rejected as faigned ſubles; for it is an abſurd thing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that one Star rules over this part, and another over that, ſeeing that all the Stars do rule over all the parts, and act not immediately, but by the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the aire, by which the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is changed and altered.</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115445:137"/>manner of every mans diet, whereby it may come to paſſe, that even in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer any man may be taken with cold and flegmatick diſeaſes. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at one and the ſame time, many men may be ſick of ſundry diſeaſes, all neither can nor ought to be purged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, and in diſeaſes that are acute, there may be danger in delay, while we ſtay till the Moon hath run through ſuch and ſuch Signes, in the mean while the opportunity of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ſick (which is ſaid to be ſwift and variable, in the firſt book of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> his Aphoriſmes) will be loſt, ſo as perhaps the like will never after of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſelf again, becauſe as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies in his Commentaries, occaſion is ſaid to be very quick, and ſoon gone, in regard that our bodies are daily changed, not only by externall cauſes, (as the Aire and Stars) but alſo by internall. From whence it comes to paſſe that they that fall together into diſeaſes at the ſame time, ought notwithſtanding to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on divers daies; for although there be the ſame aſpects of the Stars and the Moon, yet the inward temperature of the body doth diverſly alter, concoct, and expell the humours, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115445:137"/>who is a Miniſter of Nature, not of the Stars, ought to conſider, that he may adminiſter all things to the ſick in due ſeaſon. For the curing of diſeaſes is varied according to their different times. Now ſeeing that the times of diſeaſes, are in ſome longer, and in ſome ſhorter, if we waite for the aſpects of the Moon and the Stars, we thereby loſe that healthfull indication, which the times of diſeaſes do afford unto us. For in ſome diſeaſes we do not purge untill a perfect concoction of the matter be made, but in others in the beginning; now in ſome diſeaſes the beginnings are ſooner gone, and they quickly come to their height, whereas in others they are very long. Wherefore the ſame time of purging cannot be ſeaſonable for all, which it ſhould be, if the aſpects of the Moon were to be obſerved; for ſo it may fall out, that when Nature requires purging, the Moon may hinder it, and ſo all were to no purpoſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the moſt learned Phyſicians, as well ancient as moderne, with good grounds rejected theſe obſervations.</p>
                  <p>But it is more abſurd and frivolous which they talk concerning the formes of remedies;
<note place="margin">An abſurd opinion of Almanack makers.</note> for ſeeing that the very
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115445:138"/>ſame remedies may be preſcribed by a Phyſician in forme of a Potion, Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Pills, even as he pleaſes, in vain is the Moons influence regarded. For it is an eaſie thing for a Phyſician to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Electuarie <hi>Hamech, Diaſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Catholicon,</hi> or the like, in form of an Electuary, or to diſſolve it in broth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled waters, or ſome other liquor, to make it a Potion. It ſeems thoſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers do not know what Electuaries or Potions are; for although all Potions be not made of Electuaries, yet Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be changed into Potions; yea we commonly uſe the ſame purging Simples, Sene, Rubarb, Polypodie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both for Potions and Electuaries. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians do preſcribe a divers form of Phyſick, ſometimes to pleaſe the ſick, of whom ſome do more willingly take ſolid Medicines than liquid, others the contrary: Sometimes for the better purging of the remote parts, or becauſe of the toughneſſe of the matter, and other the like intentions. The ſame may be ſayd of Pills, for even the ancient Phyſicians <hi>Aetius, Paulus,</hi> and others did diſſolve Aloes, Coloquintida, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we take in Pills, even what is moſt untoothſome of all, and gave
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115445:138"/>them to the ſick to be drunk, which we adminiſter in a ſolid forme, becauſe of their too much bitterneſſe; and that they may ſtay longer in the ſtomach, when we would draw from the head, and the remote parts. Laſtly, it is to be obſerved, that what remedies ſoever are taken in a ſolid form, do melt in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, before they put forth their ſtrength into the body, which is all one, as if the Apothecary had diſſolved them in ſome liquor; for both Nature and Art do the ſame thing. Yea thoſe things that are adminiſtred in a liquid ſubſtance, do ſooner beginne to work than the other, becauſe they being already diſſolved by Art, are more eaſily overcome by Nature; and therefore in Apoplexies, and other cold diſeaſes, Phyſicians do diſſolve <hi>Pillulae Cochiae</hi> which are very bitter, in Aqua vitae, or ſome ſuch like water, that they may the ſooner put forth their ſtrength. In like manner,
<note place="margin">Another groſſe Errour of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> that which Aſtrologers talk of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, is but vain and frivolous, for whatſoever the influence of the Moon be, bloodding is never good for a Flegmatick man, or for one that is ſick of any diſeaſe that ariſes from Fleame, except together with the Fleame there
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115445:139"/>be alſo an abundance of bloud. <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe forbids to let melancholly men bloud, unleſſe the bloud which is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded doe appeare to be melancholick. It is good only for cholerick and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexions; let the Moone be in what ſigne it will, if the diſeaſe, age, and ſtrength of the party doe permit, and that for the reaſons already alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes well in his book <hi>de venae Sect.</hi> that we may let bloud at any time of the diſeaſe, if the indications of bloud-letting doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, yea though it be on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day from the beginning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. Now the indications are theſe, to wit, the greatneſs of the diſeaſe, and the ſtrength of the party, and not the diſpoſition and aſpect of the Stars, which if we ſhould obſerve, (as wee have already ſaid) we ſhould loſe the opportunity of uſing convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, to the great hazard of the ſick.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe nature being feeble enough already by reaſon of the heat, is made weaker by purging.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe the heat of the aire hinders purgation, for it drawes the humours from the center of the body to the circumference, and the Phyſick drawes them back againe to the center, and ſo there are made two contrary motions, ſo that there is either no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at all, or if any, it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. Nevertheleſſe theſe reaſons are of ſmall force in a cold Climate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in England the heat is not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and violent in the Dog-dayes, (eſpecially in the
<note n="*" place="margin">Kingſton upon Hull.</note> Northern parts of England, where I write this, where neverthelſs they feare the biting of this Dog as much as in Spaine) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cauſe to feare that our bodyes ſhould be too much inflamed, or that they ſhould be weakned, or that the humours ſhould be too forcibly drawn into the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>Again, our remedies are much more gentle than thoſe which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<note place="margin">Our reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moregentle than the Ancients.</note> as are Caſſia, Tamarinds, Sene, Rubarb, and the like, which doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115445:140"/>inflame the body, nor trouble the humours.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> becauſe though wee ſhould uſe ſtrong remedies,
<note place="margin">And our preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons better.</note> yet we can ſo prepare them, and adminiſter them in ſuch a quantity, as ſhall offer no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to the body. But ſeeing that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Country was exceeding hot, and that all his drugs that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed were very violent, and hot, it is no wonder that he was ſo wary of that time of the yeare. But in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thoſe dayes are not ſo hot. Beſides <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did not ſay abſolutely that we muſt not purge at all in the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, but only that purgation is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, not impoſſible; and therefore ſeeing that at this time of the yeare there are very many acute diſeaſes, which cannot be cured without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, and purging, the Phyſicians of hot Countryes, as Spaine, Italy, the South parts of France, and the like, doe very wiſely uſe purging remedies, but not ſo frequently, nor violent.</p>
                  <p>But ſome are of opinion, that wee ſhould abſtaine from purgation, not only becauſe of the violent heat of the weather, but for the malignant effects of the Star; and the Ancients did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115445:141"/>ſo much to this Star,
<note n="*" place="margin">It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt principall ſtar of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> that for eminencie ſake they called it <hi>the Star,</hi> as having ſome more than ordinary power above the reſt, not onely over the body, but the minde alſo; ſo that both men and beaſts, eſpecially dogs, are then more ſick than at other times, and dogs are thought to go mad through its influence. Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> alſo forbids blouding at this time: But all the miſchiefes which <hi>Plinie</hi> reckons up to proceed from hence, are not of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible credit, for they are ſeldome or never obſerved to happen here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Again, it is an abſurd thing to think that any of the Stars are miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, for they are all benigne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to man, and thoſe things which the Ancients have written concerning this Star, doe not correſpond to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. We ſee every yeare there are divers degrees of heat, and not alwaies the ſame, becauſe the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Star is altered by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Conjunctions, and Aſpects, ſo that thoſe malignant effects (if there be any) of the Dog-ſtar, may be hindred by the aſpect of other Stars. Nor doth it neceſſarily follow, if there be a great hear this yeare, that there ſhall be the ſame
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115445:141"/>the next yeare. Wherefore there is no cauſe alwayes to feare purgation under the Dog-ſtar, or all the Dog-dayes; for if this day be exceeding hot, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure to morrow the weather will be more temperate, only at this time of the year we muſt uſe remedies more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and thoſe not ſo ſtrong as at other times; for even thoſe remedies which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did ordinarily adminiſter to his Patients, are ſcarce at any time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by us, no not in winter. To this our opinion do aſſent <hi>Ioubertus</hi> in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Errours, <hi>Mercurialis, Argenterius, Hollerius</hi> in his Commentaries upon the forenamed Aphoriſme, <hi>Fernelius, Fuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Valleriola, Claudinus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alleſius,</hi> and all that have written of this ſubject.

Therefore Pills are to be adminiſtred rather in the morning than at night. I know they may be given at other times for divers intentions, as at noon, and in the evening; but alwaies long after meat. Thus <hi>Galen</hi> in the evening did adminiſter Pills made up of Aloes, Seammonie, and Coloquintida, but not after meat; for it is likely the ſick had not then ſupped, both becauſe his tongue was ſwollen, and he was ſick, for they that be ſick do ſeldome eat meat, unleſſe by conſtraint.

Yet it hath been often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that ſuch as have ſo much loathed meat, have with a very gentle Clyſter, voided many excrements dried and hardened with the violent heat of the Feaver.

In health it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115445:151"/>is good ſometimes to bee looſe in the belly, ſo as it be not too great a laſke, nor impaire the ſtrength, if ſo be (as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith) it ſtay within ſeven daies; But in them that be ſick, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good, ſometimes evill to have a laſke, in reſpect of the diverſe nature of the diſeaſe, conſtitution of the ſick, and time, as if it be a criticall flux, if ſuch things be voided as ought to bee, and it be ſuch as the ſick is well able to bear. Therefore ſometimes it is to bee let alone, ſometimes to be ſtayed; but if it be ſtayed by aſtringent remedies, the noxious humour being retained in the body, is oftentimes the cauſe of a greater evill to the body, and corrupts and infects by its contagion the reſt of the humours, whereby afterwards the noble parts are hurt, or elſe the flux re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns worſe, and is more malignant than before. It is a common proverbe among Phyſicians, The cauſes of diſeaſes muſt be taken away, before the diſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can be cured. So likewiſe in ſuch a flux, the ſafeſt way to cure it, is by taking away the cauſe, which thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging among other remedies doth moſt fitly and ſafely perform, ſo that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, the flux either ſtaies of its

Therefore it is a common ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome among Phyſicians, one flux is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by another, and one vomit by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not that all diſeaſes are cured by their like, but by accident only, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the cauſes of the flux being voided out, the flux ſtayes of its owne accord.</p>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115445:154"/>they uſe a Syringe, or a hollow pipe of tin, or braſſe, and that with better conveniencie, for it is both more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injected, and alſo more ſafely,

For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally a clyſter doth not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the great guts, by reaſon of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>valvule</hi> placed in the beginning of the gut Colon, and the end of Ilion, it would be much to the commodity of the ſick, if a clyſter could but goe ſo farre, for ſo a great benefit would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to them by the waſhing of the guts. But a clyſter that is injected by a bladder doth not aſcend ſo high, but ſtayes in the ſtrait gut, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Colon. It were well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that theſe Syringes were brought into uſe, of which almoſt all our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, except thoſe of London, are deſtitute.

Therefore if any man that is ignorant of the art of Phyſick, chance to obſerve ſuch a thing, let him neither blame the Phyſician nor the Clyſter, ſeeing that no Phyſician can foreknow this, but let him accuſe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſtitution of the ſick, and know that nothing happens then, which hath not been heretofore, nor let him be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at ſuch an event.</p>

                  <p>IT is not my purpoſe in this Chapter to treat of the commoditie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe of vomits to the body of man, I wil only give notice of thus much about the uſe therof, that there are ſome <hi>Vomitories</hi> which do only cleanſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and others which draw humours from all the parts of the body, which in ſundry diſeaſes are more profitable
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115445:155"/>than the former. When therefore one hath taken a vomit, let him not haſten as many do, to the uſe of poſſets; for by filling the ſtomack, they do too ſoon ſtirre up the working of the vomit, which is thereby caſt out of the ſtomach, before it hath diffuſed its vertue into the whole body, and ſo it doth not at all attract the noxious humours, and yet moleſts the ſtomach not a whit the leſſe. But let him rather reſt awhile, till it be reduced into act, and work twice or thrice without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any drink at all: Thus wee ſhall be ſure, that only thoſe things which be hurtfull in the ſtomach and body, ſhall be voided out.</p>
                  <p>Where it is to be noted, that poſſet drinks are not preſcribed by Phyſicians that they may further the operation of the vomit;

I muſt needs comfeſſe therefore that the patient doth vomit the eaſier after meat, but with leſſe commoditie: But if the ſick be prone and apt to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, it is better to provoke vomit faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and before meat or drinke; for ſo the Phyſick drawes the humours better out of the veines. <hi>Gentilis</hi> and <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115445:156"/>Chapter of the cure of a quartane Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>If the patient vomit eaſily, it may be adminiſtred before meat, to draw me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy from the Spleen to the ſtomach: But if it come difficultly, it is better to give it after meat, that he may vomit the eaſier,</hi> which may alſo be applyed to drink ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken preſently after. If therefore the vomit be preſcribed, only for emptying the ſtomach from groſſe humours, it will not be amiſſe firſt to eat or drink, or at leaſt preſently after. But if the whole body be to be cleanſed, it muſt be taken faſting, and the patient muſt not eat nor drink any thing after, untill the vertue of the Medicine brought into act, hath penetrated the whole body, becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the taking of drink, the attractive vertue of the remedie is dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                  <p>THe common people moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are diſpoſed to thwart and contradict Phyſicians, which as in many other particulars may bee ſeen in this, that if one be ſick of a Fever, wherein it is profitable, yea neceſſary to let blood, they are ready to excuſe declining age, as not able to endure this remedy, and this I have often heard of ſome not fifty yeares old, and otherwiſe very ſtrong, and vigorous. Indeed in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of all remedies, the ſtrength of the patient ought eſpecially to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, inſomuch as if it be defective, we muſt withhold ſtrong remedies even from a boy, or a young man. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not the ſame duration and continuance of ſtrength in all, but ſome at threeſcore and ten are more cheerfull and vigorous than others at fifty, the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115445:157"/>Phyſician regards not ſo much the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeares,
<note place="margin">Phyſicians regard not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years but ſtrength.</note> as the ſtrength and vigour of the ſick. Therefore if a ſtrong old man be troubled with the Pleuriſie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Lungs, burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or other ſuch diſeaſes, there is no doubt but he may, and ought to be let blood, for theſe diſeaſes can ſcarce bee cured without this remedy; but if the ſick have not ſtrength to endure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, he muſt of neceſſity periſh, and ſo all diſeaſes in old men ſhould be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe in his booke of <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> preſcribes blooding for old men of threeſcore and ten years, and I my ſelf have ſeen a man threeſcore and thirteene years old, who was let blood, foure times within the ſpace of three daies, and had thirty ounces of blood at the leaſt taken from him. <hi>Rhazes</hi> alſo did let blood in a decrepit old man, which was ſick of a grievous Pleuriſie. Therefore age is not to be meaſured by the number of years, but by the ſtrength of the patient, which if it be vigorous in very old men, why ſhall remedies, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their diſeaſes, bee denied them? It is indeed certain, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old man is weaker than when he was young, and therefore hee muſt bee let
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115445:158"/>blood more ſparingly than if he were yet young, nevertheſſe it may be that if hee were compared to another young man, he would bee found ſtronger than he, and more able to endure phyſick. There is then no age, except decrepit old age, but it may endure ſome evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now decrepit old age, becauſe it hath but little blood, and very many raw humours, is unfit for this remedie. But the other ages, that are in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle betwixt the firſt and the laſt, have their degrees of ſtrength, and therefore doe admit of ſome ſort of evacuation. This did <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> teach very well.

The ſame may be ſaid of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before they be fourteen years old; for even childhood hath its ſtrength,
<note place="margin">Children may bee purged or blooded.</note> for even childhood hath its ſtrength, and vigour, according to the proportion whereof, why ſhall it not be lawfull to evacuate, eſpecially if he be a boy of a good habit of body, with large veines; well and freely educated. They endure

They are wont ſometimes to bee wounded, and to bleed very much, without any harme at all to them, why may they not alſo abide artificiall emiſſion of bloud?

It is manifeſt enough that all the veines of the arme, in that they proceed from one and the ſame trunck, do evacuate from the ſame parts, and that which is called the cephalick vein, and is referred to the head, doth no leſſe evacuate from the liver, than that which they call the baſilick and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vein, although this ſame cephalick veine, becauſe it ſometimes receives a little branch from the head, is thought to be more profitable for the affects of the head, yet both of them do equally help the diſeaſes of the inward parts, and draw bloud alike from the hollow vein.

                  <p>IT is an ordinary thing, not only with the people, but alſo with Phyſicians, when they let bloud, to define the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof by ounces and pounds, which alſo was <hi>Galens</hi> cuſtome, who ſometimes drew bloud even to many pounds.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115445:161"/>becauſe of the quantity, or ſome other fault: now the quantity of liquids is better diſcerned by meaſures than by weights, for one bloud is heavier than another. As for example; let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Titius</hi> his bloud to bee heavy, he having a <hi>plethore,</hi> or fulneſſe thereof <hi>ad vaſa,</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> his bloud to bee light, he having a fulneſſe thereof <hi>ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> if you take ſix ounces of bloud from each of them, <hi>Titius</hi> his bloud, becauſe it is heavier, will be contained in fewer veſſels, and <hi>Sempronius</hi> his bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is lighter, will fill more veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. So that if from each of them the ſame weight of bloud bee taken, yet the latter hath bled more than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

So likewiſe in emptying a veſſell, he takes more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that out of one veſſell drawes a pottle of the ſpirit of wine, than he that out of another takes half a pottle of ſtones, although perhaps this weighs
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115445:161"/>heavier. Seeing then there is the ſame reaſon in bloud, becauſe one is more ponderous than another, if in letting bloud we only conſider its weight, we ſhall never define well the quantity thereof; for it is contained in the veins not as heavy, but as filling, unleſſe one imagine the ſame ponderoſity and weight of bloud in all men, which I think no man will dare to affirm. The quantity of bloud (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by the more or leſſe faultineſſe of it, and by the ſtrength of the party, and according to theſe two, is more or leſſe bloud to be drawne. So that in a great diſtemper of the bloud, the ſtrength being vigorous, we muſt uſe a larger evacuation; but in a light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, the ſtrength being feeble, we muſt let bloud more ſparingly. But if you judge of the quantity by the weight, it may ſo fall out, that when the ſick is feeble in ſtrength, you may draw more bloud than when he is moſt lively &amp; vigorous, which is a groſſe treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt the rules of Phyſick. For if in debility of ſtrength the bloud be lighter, and in validity of ſtrength it be heavier, if in this latter caſe you take halfe a pound of bloud, and in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115445:162"/>the former but foure ounces, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels into which theſe foure ounces are taken, will be as full by reaſon of the levity of the bloud, as thoſe veſſels which receive the half pound of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ponderous bloud, and ſo the ſame quantity of bloud is taken from them both, which ſhould not have been done. Nor do I ſee any reaſon, why the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bloud ſhould bee defined by weight, more than the dejections of the belly in a purgation, ſeeing that out of the veines the humours alſo are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for under the manition of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels is purging contained, as faith <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>aph. lib.</hi> 1.</note> Seeing therefore the veſſels are not replete with any thing, as heavy, for the capacity of the veſſels is not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, although the weight of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents be different; and it is apparent, that a greater quantity of oyle than of honey goes to an ounce; it will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the future, if the quantity of bloud be accounted by meaſures, and not by ounces, and pounds, ſeeing the judgment thereof may be ſo deceitfull. I know there were among the Ancients as well pounds in meaſure, as in weight, for their veſſels were drawn about with lines, whereby the pounds and ounces
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115445:162"/>were marked out, and whatſoever they meaſured after this manner, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Menſurall:</hi> As for example, a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurall pound of oyle or wine, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Galen</hi> meant, when he drew bloud according to ounces and pounds. But becauſe the things that were meaſured were of divers weight, the pound in weight did ſeldome countervaile the pound in meaſure: for though there may be the ſame meaſure of oyl, wine, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet there is not the ſame weight, and therefore that manner of meaſuring was very uncertaine, and we now adayes have no ſuch veſſels as doe marke out ounces and pounds, nor if wee had plenty of them, could wee uſe them, without a manifeſt errour, in reſpect of the different weight of the bloud. Therefore though I doe not diſallow the received cuſtome, yet I thinke it ſafer to judge of the quantity of bloud by meaſure, than by weight.</p>

                  <p>AMong many obſervations of the people, this is not the leaſt, that they are very wary leſt the ſick ſleep, or eat
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115445:163"/>and drink preſently after he hath been let bloud, which was alſo the opinion of ſome Phyſicians, becauſe they think the bloud returnes to the heart, which nevertheleſſe is not alwayes true, except there bee an immoderate evacuation of bloud, or timorouſneſs, which may cauſe ſwouning. However, no reaſon enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that that return of the bloud ſhould be ſo pernicious.</p>
                  <p>And firſt concerning ſleep: the bloud is wont in ſleep to recoile into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, to the exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of nature:
<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſleep to the ſick.</note> Now in them that be ſick, who have not ſlept for many nights, all men know what great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a little ſleep affords, for it repaires the ſtrength, concocts the morbous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and corrects them; wherefore we are oftentimes forced to apply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to provoke ſleep. Therefore if immediately, or a little after bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting ſleep doe enſue, it may be good, both as a ſigne, and a cauſe. As a <hi>ſigne,</hi> becauſe it ſhewes that nature which was oppreſſed with the morbous humours, is now refreſhed, and ſo doth performe its naturall functions. As a <hi>cauſe,</hi> it may be good, becauſe when once ſleep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, nature doth concoct the remainder
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115445:163"/>of the morbous humour.
<note place="margin">In what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſleep is forbidden.</note> I know in ſome diſeaſes ſleep is not good, as in the inflammations of the internall parts, in the beginnings of fits, and in peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall diſeaſes. Therefore in thoſe diſeaſes, it is not good to ſleep imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after bloud-letting; but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes, I ſee no reaſon why the Patient may not ſleep. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that if the ſick after long and tedious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do fall to ſleep, it indicates a perfect <hi>criſis,</hi> for ſometimes it falls out,

                     </note> * that the ſick after the <hi>criſis</hi> ſleeps a whole day, eſpecially when he hath not ſlept, of a long time before, and that to the great ſolace and refreſhment of nature. Yea ſometimes it happens that the ſick ſleeps in the very <hi>criſis.</hi> If therefore ſleep be good after other evacuations, why not alſo after bleeding? Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſometimes it falls out, that in ſome feavers, ſuch a preternaturall ſleep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the ſick, that he can ſcarce be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, and yet many times in ſuch feavers it is very good to let bloud, as of late I did to a woman that lay in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute feaver, poſſeſſed with an heavy ſleep, who otherwiſe had ſcarce recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, being adjudged of all as a dying woman. If therefore with good ſucceſs
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115445:164"/>bloud may be drawne from one that is actually aſleep, why ſhall ſleep be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full immediatly after blouding? <hi>Galen</hi> ſeemes to account it a good thing,
<note place="margin">9 <hi>method. cap.</hi> 4.</note> that the ſick after blouding falls into a ſound ſleep. <hi>Two houres</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>after hee was let bloud, having given him a little meat, and commended him to reſt, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: And returning at the fifth houre, I found him lying in a ſound ſleep, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he did not feele me when I touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Then comming againe at the tenth houre, I found him ſtill faſt aſleep; Afterward having beene abroad to viſit ſome other Patients, I came againe in the fifth houre of the night, not being ſilent as before, but of purpoſe with a loud voice to awake him from his ſleep.</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome will ſay <hi>Galen</hi> did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſleep, till two hours after bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting. I anſwer, it had been well, if the ſick could have ſlept immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he had been let bloud; and in no place doth <hi>Galen</hi> diſallow that, for we know we cannot alwayes ſleep when we deſire it. But ſeeing the aforeſaid ſick man could not ſleep, comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine two houres after, he bade him lye ſtill, that he might ſleep, which <hi>Galen</hi> had not done, if he had judged ſleep to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115445:164"/>be hurtfull after blooding. If any man object, that ſleep is prohibited leſt the ligature ſhould be looſed, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient bleed againe; that is nothing; for that may be prevented by the diligent care of the by-ſtanders, and the ſure binding of it.

                     <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus</hi> the Portugall proves that it is not hurtfull immediately after blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but very wholſome, commanding that the patient doe preſently drinke a little cold water; for in regard that the veines are emptied, it is inſtantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the whole body, and doth both eaſier, ſooner, and ſafelier coole the body.</p>

                  <p>ANd this Errour is none of the leaſt, that if a woman with childe be ſick, they will not ſuffer her to take Phyſick, nor to be let bloud, for fear of an aborſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is contrary to reaſon, the authority of the Ancients, and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Fevers in women with child are moſt dangerous.</note> Therefore no delay is to be made in applying remedies. Again, in reſpect that the child is nouriſhed with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood, if ſhe be ſick, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leſt through that ſickneſſe, and the corruption of the blood, the childe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, which if it happen, as ſometimes it doth, then is the mother in danger, both by reaſon of the diſeaſe, and of the dead childe, namely, leſt ſhe being weakened by the diſeaſe, the childe dye through putrefaction of the blood, and ſhe bee not able to bear the childe; at leaſt never doth an aborſement happen without danger. Now it is evident enough, that theſe evills cannot be prevented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking away the cauſe (for indeed no diſeaſe can be cured otherwiſe) and the cauſe cannot be taken away without blood-letting,

                     </label> If a Phyſician can cure a woman with childe ſick of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Fever, without blood-letting or purging, much more eaſily may he cure her of the ſame diſeaſe without theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115445:165"/>when ſhe is not with childe, and ſo the uſe of them might be quite aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. But if he cannot cure her not being with childe without thoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he cannot then cure her being with childe, and ſick of the ſame diſeaſe. For the ſame diſeaſe indicates the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, and the being with child doth not take away the indication of the diſeaſe, but onely after a ſort alters the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of remedies, and the manner of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them. Yea much rather are theſe remedies to be uſed in women with childe, inaſmuch as they ſtand in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter need of help than others. But they think that all the nouriſhment is drawn from the childe by blood-letting, and that there is danger of abortion by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and other remedies:
<note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the childe is from the diſeaſe, not the remedy</note> All this while not knowing that great danger hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the childe, by reaſon of the blood being corrupted, to wit, leſt it die, and kill the mother, who is already wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened with the diſeaſe, ſo that there is more danger of abortion from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe than from the remedy.

<note place="margin">The child becomes more lively after blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> for there is blood enough left behinde to ſuffice both the child, and its mother.

This happens oftentimes, becauſe the force of the Phyſick is much weakened before it come to the infant, and the wombe endeavours to its utmoſt to keep in the childe, and but with great violence will not part with it before the time. There is another reaſon taken from the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115445:167"/>birth; for when the womb endeavours to put forth the perfect infant, then doe theſe remedies help the travail, but they availe little or nothing when the womb ſtrives to retaine the infant.

Some will have naturall Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver to be cold, and the artificiall hot: which controverſie in this place we will not ſpend time to decide. Alſo ſome moderne Phyſicians will have it to be a poyſon. If it be taken in too great a quantitie, it congeales the blood, ſaith <hi>Conciliator,</hi> producing the example of a certaine Druggiſt, who being in a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fever, inſtead of a glaſſe of water to quench his thirſt, unhappily chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to light on a glaſſe full of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, and drinking up a great quantity thereof, he dyed congealed, inſomuch as when his dead body was opened, the Phyſicians found the blood about his throat congealed and frozen. <hi>Fernel</hi> likewiſe is altogether againſt the uſing of it. But others more rightly taught by experience, do affirme that it is not ſo hurtfull. As for <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> he ſaies
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115445:169"/>that it hurts onely by reaſon of its weight and ponderoſitie, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe, unleſſe it bee taken in a great quantity. <hi>Galen</hi> confeſſes, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made triall of it, whether it kills or no, being taken by the mouth, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed outwardly, ſo that if at any time he reckoned it among the poyſons, he ſeems to have done it according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens opinion, not out of his owne judgement and experience. And the moderne Phyſicians have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it may ſafely be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, if it doe not exceed due meaſure. For no medicine is taken in exceſſive quantitie without hurt to the body. And therefore if it did congeale the blood, as <hi>Conciliator</hi> ſpeakes, that was onely by reaſon of the too great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for that cauſe it muſt not bee thought to be of a more noxious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than other medicaments.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115445:172"/>indeed the name of preparation ſeems to point at ſome notable thing.

It is adminiſtred quick, ſaith <hi>Matthiolus</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Laureus,</hi> and not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſſolved, as ſo me think. <hi>For that which is quenched, doth ſtick to the ſtomack and bowels, and ſtirres up grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſymptomes.</hi> Where it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that quick-ſilver is prepared divers wayes, both for purging, and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking of ſweat. But in none of theſe preparations is the nature thereof ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, but onely hidden; and though it be diverſly commixed, yet it remaines entire, and with a little art returnes to its own nature.
<note place="margin">Mercury ſublimate and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate moſt dangerous poyſons.</note> But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it is fixed by the mixture of ſalt ſpirits in ſublimate, and precipitate, ſo as that which before might be uſed without danger, is now become a moſt violent poyſon; for ſeeing that of it ſelfe it is of a quick operation, thoſe ſharp ſpirits, one drop whereof doth burne whatſoever it touches, doe the

<note place="margin">Crude Mercury ſafer then any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of it.</note> becauſe the crude Mercury holds faſter together, and is very moveable, and therefore is quickly voided out of the belly.

Nevertheleſſe I doe not believe that it may be more ſafely uſed than the crude; for this ſweet Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is made out of ſublimate, which is a moſt violent poyſon, whereunto they adde ſome crude quick-ſilver, which is ſublimated the ſecond time, and ſo by the mixture thereof, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding vertue of the ſpirits of the ſalt, and vitriol. doe vaniſh away, and it is made a ſweet powder, which before
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115445:173"/>was very ſharp. Here I doe not ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preparation at all, but onely a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mixture and addition of quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the nature of which doth for all that remaine whole and entire, and with a ſlight art is brought to its former temper. But if Mercury ſublimate be ſuch a deadly poyſon, the enſuing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of live Mercury doth not take away the force thereof, but only allay it, and ſo the ſtrength being diſperſed, it is weaker than when it was united. And it is manifeſt for this reaſon: to wit, becauſe there is the ſame reaſon of naturall things of the ſame kinde. When it is firſt ſublimated, the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſalt ſpirits with the quick-ſilver, makes it to become noxious, yet the quick-ſilver it ſelfe doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thoſe ſpirits their force and violence, but rather friendly unites it ſelfe with them: Afterwards, when freſh quick-ſilver is added thereto, to make it ſweet, in regard that it is of the ſame nature with the former, it doth likewiſe conjoyne it ſelf with the fore-named ſpirits, and can no more abate their violence than the former quick ſilver. But becauſe there is a greater quantity of quick-ſilver added
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115445:173"/>than was in it before, although the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid ſpirits in their owne nature, are no leſſe forcible than they were, yet they cannot do ſo much harm, becauſe they are allayed and corrected; as a few drops of the ſpirit of vitriol mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, may be drunk, which otherwiſe is a corroſive medicament. And therefore this ſweet Mercury is not ſo ſafe as that which hath not been ſublimated. But if crude quick-ſilver, being mixed with mercury ſublimate, doth take away the poyſon thereof,
<note place="margin">Nihil dat quod non habet.</note> and makes it harmleſſe, much more ſhall it ſelf be harmleſſe: <hi>Nothing gives that which it hath not.</hi> If therefore it doth give reliſh and ſweetneſſe to that moſt ſtrong poyſon, without doubt it hath it in it ſelfe; for <hi>propter quod u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numquodque est tale, illudeſt magis tale.</hi> If then the onely commixture of the crude quick-ſilver doth make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate to become wholſome and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to mans body, much more ſhall it ſelf be wholſome and profitable. The ſtories recited in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe manifeſt as much, from which it plainly appeares, that quick-ſilver e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unprepared, hath been adminiſtred with very good ſucceſſe.

<note place="margin">Cautions in uſing of quickſilver</note> that if it bee taken in too great a quantity, or if there be no corrupt humours in the body for it to work upon, it may doe harm; as alſo it is not ſo good for the cholerick and melancholick, as for the phlegmatick. But if for that cauſe quick-ſilver were to be rejected, in like manner almoſt all remedies ſhould be abandoned from any uſe in Phyſick. For they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good for one, but they may hurt another, yea even all, if they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in too great a quantity, or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably.</p>

Which opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath learned men for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Abettors, yet to me it doth not ſeem altogether agreeable to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For that which provokes ſleepe, doth it by a vapour either ſtirred up in the brain, or carried up thither, or by furthering concoction, for then do we ſleep moſt ſoundly, when the ſtomack is not overcharged with meat. It aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwages paine, becauſe it either takes away, or alters the cauſe thereof, but it doth not benumme the part affected by any narcotick quality; thus I have ſeen inveterate head-ache cured with Tobacco.

<note place="margin">Tobacco is not good in conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lungs.</note> yet I do not think it to be convenient for them, whoſe conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption happens from a defluxion of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115445:177"/>rhewme upon the Lungs. For though it draws the pituitous humours from the brain, yet it inclines nature at other times to ſend downe the humours into the breaſt. Therfore becauſe according to the rules of Phyſicians, we ſhould never draw towards the affected part, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw back, or divert the humours from it, thoſe things which purge the head by the mouth ſhould not be uſed; I commend rather evacuation by the noſtrils, as more convenient.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is obſervable, that many are groſly erroneous in the uſe of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
<note place="margin">Not good to drink with To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.</note> in that when they take it, they are continually drinking, yea and ſome make themſelves drunk, hereby berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves of that benefit, that would accrew to them by the right thereof. For though it may ſeeme to reſolve the humours, to heat, and dry the braine (and a hot and dry braine doth generate fewer excrements,
<note place="margin">In arte medic cap. de ſignis catidi &amp; fitri cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri.</note> ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) yet a braine of that temperature doth draw unto it more forcibly, and is more ſubject to be replete with vapours
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115445:177"/>ariſing from the inferiour parts, ſo that afterwards being every day filled with freſh vapours, it becomes leſſe ſenſible of that benefit of drying, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in the aforeſaid place. <hi>When the braine is hot and dry</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the head is more then ordinarily filled with vapours (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore ſome ſuch thing befalls thoſe men, eſpecially when they keep not a good diet) they are troubled with more excrements, but not ſo crude, their heads are filled and oppreſſed with vapours after the uſe of hot meats, drinkes, ſmels, and all ſuch things as happen from without.</hi> And this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to reaſon, for vapours doe quickly aſcend to any part that is made hotter than ordinary. Seeing then by the taking of Tobacco the brain is made hotter, if men obſerve not a good diet, but poure in abundance of Wine, Ale, and ſuch vaporous drinke (as indeed they uſe too frequently to do) the head is the ſooner filled againe, ſo that it is obſervable, that they that take Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, doe ſpit forth more excrements by the mouth and palate, than they that take none at all, by reaſon of drunkennes and intemperance, which is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with many.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THat Tobacco is good, and in no wiſe hurtfull, wee have already ſhewne, and the whole Nation of the Weſt-Indians doth witneſſe as much, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom there is ſcarce one of a thouſand, that doth not take it, and yet they live there very long. Now when it is taken into the mouth, it is eaſie to be obſerved, that as much ſmoake is puffed out againe, as was ſucked in; for it is all contained in the mouth that is taken. Wherefore I have thought it falſe which ſome imagine, namely, that it goes up into the Braine. Nor is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that it be carried up thither; for Maſticatories, and Gargariſmes, which are appointed for drawing of humours out of the head, although they be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the mouth, do nevertheleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their force to the Braine, and it is not abſurd to thinke, that this attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drying fume is of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. But beſides it is eaſie to prove that the ſmoke of Tobacco taken into the mouth, is not carried up to the Brain.</p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:115445:179"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> in that we only perceive the taſt, and not the ſmell of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe wee receive the ſmoke by inſpiring, keep it by holding the breath, and puffe it out again by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring. Indeed when we inſpire by the noſtrils, the aire goes to the braine, but when wee inſpire by the mouth, it is carried only to the Lungs and the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. Seeing then the aforeſaid ſmoke is attracted by inſpiring by the mouth, it doth not go into the Brain. <hi>When wee expire, or when wee hold our breath</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Galen) <hi>wee never ſmell, although the ſent bee in the very noſtrils; for in expiring we repell the ſmoke together with the aire.</hi> Againe, in holding the breath, wee doe not admit it into the braine, becauſe when we hold our breath no aire paſſes to the braine of its own accord, ſeeing the braine is already full of the aire that was inſpired; and this is the reaſon why wee doe not perceive the ſmell of thoſe things that are holden in the mouth, and the ſtomach, (otherwiſe a man were not able to endure himſelfe) becauſe the perception of ſmels is made by inſpiration onely; but by the mouth we doe not inſpire into the braine. From whence it neceſſarily followes, that the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115445:179"/>ſmoke of Tobacco taken in at the mouth is not carried up thither. Beſides if it ſhould pierce ſo farre, in that theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours are very ſharp, they would vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently diſaffect and pull the brain, and provoke ſneezing, and other affects which are not uſuall. As we ſee that if the ſame ſmoke be inſpired by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, immediately it cauſes ſneezing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then it is indeed carried to the braine. Let it therefore remaine eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that the head is affected one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the vertue of it, and not that the ſubſtance thereof doth pierce into it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will object, that by long uſing it, a heavineſſe in the head is cauſed, and dizzineſſe, and the braine is as it were intoxicated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> But I anſwer, that it comes to paſſe onely by the frequent and daily taking of it, which would quickly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if the ſinoke ſhould fill the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the braine: For dizzineſſe is not alwaies cauſed by vapours, but may proceed alſo from the ſpirits, when they are too much heated, and agitated, or from the vapours of the humours, that are ſtirred up by the immoderate heat of that ſmoke, and from divers other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115445:180"/>which would be too tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite here. Yea ſome have ſuch weake heads, that they are ſoon taken with dizzineſſe, through any light externall cauſe, ſo as they may be alſo taken with it by the ſmoke of Tobacco, although it enter not into the head, namely, through ſome inward cauſe ſtirred up by it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, many times a great purgation may cauſe dizzineſſe,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 37.</note> as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſes in his booke concerning them, for whom pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is convenient. Wherefore it is no wonder, if the braine be too much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the immoderate uſe of it, and the ſpirits exceedingly heated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, doe draw unto them corrupt humours from the lower parts, which cauſe heavineſſe of the head, and dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, although the ſubſtance of the ſmoke doth not reach thereto.</p>

                  <p>I Have heard ſome averre that Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co is a preſervative againſt the Plague. <hi>Monardes</hi> commends it againſt poyſon, but eſpecially againſt wounds that are made by poyſoned weapons, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſts.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115445:180"/>hereof, doe underſtand of the green herbe, or of the juice thereof applied to the affected part, and not of the ſmoke taken as now adayes they uſe it. Yet it may be that the ſmoke may doe good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Plague, but not as many think,
<note place="margin">Tobacco ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h not any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotary quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the plague.</note> by any antidotary qualitie that it hath againſt poyſon, but for other cauſes. For thoſe things that preſerve from the Plague, are either ſuch as cleanſe the body from excrements, or that dry it, whereby it doth not ſo eaſily receive the poyſon. Now that the ſmoke of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco doth dry the braine and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and voyd out the humours by the mouth, and ſometimes by vomit, it is evident enough; and thus perhaps it preſerves from the Plague. But no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar vertue of effecting that after this manner is found in the ſmoke; for thoſe things that doe evacuate, doe onely by accident preſerve from the Plague, as purging, bloodding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore no reaſon enforces that we ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the ſmoke any peculiar vertue of preſerving from the Plague. But beſides many obſerve that in the Plague a man ought to abſtaine from all ſtrong purgers, becauſe the humours are then ſoon diſturbed by any light cauſe. I
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115445:181"/>know very many have promiſed that they would cure the plague, or preſerve men from it, by vomits of Antimony, when perhaps they could not defend themſelves from it. As <hi>Platerus</hi> in his obſervations reports of one <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſtein</hi> a famous Chymiſt, who in his writings profeſſed a moſt certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of curing or preventing the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who nevertheleſſe got it himſelfe at <hi>Baſil,</hi> when it was almoſt quite ceaſed, and died of it. So infirme and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine are all thoſe things which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt this ſort of poyſon, but eſpecially vomitories who do debilitate a noble part, and offer great violence to Nature.</p>
                  <p>There is another manner of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the Plague, to wit, by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, which have alſo a vertue of curing it; for the very ſame things in a manner are good both againſt eminent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſeaſes. But as yet we have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of any ſuch vertue in Tobacco, for ſo many thouſands of men, whom that great plague at <hi>London,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places in this Kingdome have ſwept away, the greateſt part of whom did without doubt take Tobacco, are as ſo many witneſſes to teſtifie, that there
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115445:181"/>is no ſuch vertue therein, and none of them that recovered, can attribute any thing to Tobacco as a means of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. But if it hath no curing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it hath no preſerving qualitie nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Moreover they muſt know that other poyſons have their proper Antidotes,
<note place="margin">The Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence hath no proper Antidote.</note> but the Peſtilence hath none at all, only Phyſicians uſe cordiall remedies, not whereby the poyſon is extinguiſhed, but onely Nature fortified againſt the force of the poyſon, which it afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels by ſweat, or ſome other emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the body. But that there is not any cordiall vertue in Tobacco, the diz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, ſwounings, cold ſweats, vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and other ſymptomes that are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by it do manifeſt, which rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token a venemous than a cordiall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Therefore although I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it doth any hurt, yet I thinke it doth not much good. Moreover the braine (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in <hi>Arte Medicâ,</hi> in the chapter concerning the ſignes of an hot braine) is eaſily offended with the ambient aire; <hi>Thoſe that have hot brains (ſaith he) their heads are very ſubject to be distempered with hot meats, drinkes, and ſmells, and all thoſe things that doe occurre
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115445:182"/>from without, among which the circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent aire may be reckoned.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing by the uſe of Tobacco the braine is very much heated, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leſt it bee offended with the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall aire. Hence it is that old men are not ſo ſoon infected with the plague as young men are, becauſe of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their bodies, as alſo <hi>Plinie</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
                  <p>But in that this plant is ſaid to be good for poyſoned wounds, and the bitings of venemous beaſts, it followes not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt have an antidotary facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the Spaniards did firſt uſe ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate for ſuch wounds, and wee doe uſually preſcribe divers things which in their proper nature are not preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt poyſon, but are either ſuch as draw out the venome, or that extinguiſh it, as an actuall cautery, and ſuch like. And it may bee that Tobacco may likewiſe bee good for that too, although it hath no proper or peculiar vertue for to reſiſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BEcauſe in all diſeaſes ſpeciall care ought to bee had of the ſtrength of the patient, it is no wonder if the ſick be ſo deſirous to have their ſtrength pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, from whence ariſes ſuch a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of cordiall remedies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that ſome are often blaming Phyſicians becauſe they doe ſo ſeldome preſcribe Cordialls and Antidotes for them, eſpecially at night and when they lye down to ſleep. Notwithſtanding the unſeaſonable uſe of them, doth moſt commonly more hurt than good, as doth Triacle, Mithridate, and the like. For not every thing that is ſaid to be cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all doth by and by ſtrengthen nature, nay it may deſtroy it, and thus the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of cold water doth more help one that is in a Fever than Aqua caeleſtis, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialis Triacle water, or any other ſtrong water whatſoever. And it is to be obſerved, that the imbecillitie of the heart, and the decay of the ſtrength which depends upon the ſpirits in the heart, may proceed from divers cauſes; now every ſort of remedy is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for cauſes ſo different. But if the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115445:183"/>cauſe of the diſeaſe bee encreaſed by ſome kind of remedy, although it may be ſayd to be a Cordiall, the Cordiall is no better than poyſon to the ſick; as if an hot remedy bee applyed in an hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, the diſeaſeis increaſed, and the ſick is not a whit ſtrengthned, but made weaker. Therefore they are too blame, who without judgement and ſkill doe preſcribe theſe cordiall and ſtrengthning medicines. Moreover it is obſervable, that it is poſſible that Triacle, Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, and other ſuch like, which are in moſt frequent uſe, may doe much hurt: For as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">5. Simpl.</note> they are a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the body and poyſons, ſo that there is the ſame proportion betwixt the body and the Antidote, that there is betwixt the Antidote and the poyſon; and therefore hee ſaith, that all thoſe things that are of the nature of Triacle,
<note place="margin">Cordials do hurt if there bee not matter within to work upon</note> and Mithridate, being taken in too great a quantity do hurt the body, as alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be ſome poyſon within, upon which they may worke. I know this compariſon of <hi>Galen</hi> doth not pleaſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrhoes</hi> that ſubtle Phyſician and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
<note place="margin">5. <hi>colliget. cap.</hi> 23.</note> who notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that they do the body no good at all, unleſſe they bee taken in a ſtomach,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115445:183"/>that hath in it ſome poyſonous matter for them to worke upon, and therefore (ſaith he) they are not good for them that be in health, but become as poyſon to them, as likewiſe do all thoſe things which are commonly called Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. For by their forcible working, unleſſe they bee diſcreetly adminiſtred, they hurt the body like poyſon; and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> forbids Triacle to them that are hot and dry, as alſo to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Although therefore I do not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſlike the uſing of theſe ſorts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, nor judge them to be venemous or pernicious, yet hence it follows, that they are to be uſed very warily; for they have qualities in them that are many times very hurtfull to the body, except they meet with an object in the body for to worke upon. And therefore corroborating and cordiall remedies are to differ according to the variety of diſeaſes, hence it is that ſome of them are cold, ſome hot, ſome temperate, ſome corroborating the heart with an occult, and unexplicable property, ſome reſiſting poyſons which cannot bee fit for all thoſe different cauſes, from whence a decay of ſtrength may come.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115445:184"/>And therefore thoſe things may very fitly be numbred among Cordials, which doe relieve nature by evacuating the cauſes of diſeaſes, and by altering, which thing many of our ordinary Cordialls doe not performe, and ſuch remedies ought to be called Cordialls <hi>by accident</hi> onely, nevertheleſſe they are the moſt certaine of all others.

But among us, it is peculiarly taken for that ſtone ſo much in uſe, which is taken out of ſome creatures, and brought to us out India. Now ſuch is thought to bee the excellency of this ſtone by ſome, that they preferre it before all others, for the <hi>Arabians</hi> do highly commend it againſt poyſons, the plague, jaundice, and all obſtructions of the body and bowels. <hi>Avenzoar</hi> in his booke <hi>Theiſier,</hi> ſaith that he ſaved one that had taken moſt deadly poyſon, with three graines of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaar, diſſolved in five ounces of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gourds. But if wee conſider well what <hi>Avenzoar</hi> writes concerning that ſtone, wee ſhall finde that it is not our ſtone which is brought unto us from the Indies, but the teare of an Hart,
<note place="margin">A precious ſtone drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from the eye of a Hart.</note> of which he talkes ſo much. The Hart, as <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo teſtifies, by the breath of his noſtrils drawes ſerpents out of their holes, and eats them, immediately he is taken with a grievous thirſt, for the quenching whereof he runs to ſome ſtanding poole, in which he plunges himſelf up to the neck, but through natures inſtinct hee drinks not; for if he ſhould, hee would
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115445:186"/>fall down dead preſently. Then a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine humour diſtils to his eyes, which by degrees, thickens, unites, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts together, and grows to the bigneſs of an acorne, which afterwards being come out of the water the Hart ſhakes off, and is ſought for by men, which ſome call the Bezaar ſtone, being as they ſay broad, tending to a Pyramis, of the colour of honey,

But this ſtone of ours is not the teare of the Hart, which is too rare, if ever there were ſuch a ſtone: But this ſtone which wee uſe is very common. Now it is,
<note place="margin">Severall ſorts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaar ſtones</note> as writers teſtifie, of divers ſorts, yellow, duſkiſh, whitiſh,; but the yellow is the beſt, then the duſkiſh: <hi>Rhazes</hi> writes thus of it, it is a ſoft ſtone, of a yellow colour, without any taſt, which he ſaith, he uſed with good ſucceſſe againſt the poyſon of Wolves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane. Now it was of a yellow colour, tending to white, light, and gliſtering like light. But <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> Phyſician to the Viceroy of India, deſcribes it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, who nevertheleſſe confeſſes,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115445:186"/>that he had only heard, that ſome by the uſe thereof had been preſerved from deplorable diſeaſes, and he will have it to be of a dark green colour; and he ſaith that they muſt all of neceſſity bee brought to the King of the country, and that they cannot without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee had from thence, and therefore ſeeing they are now ſo common, much doubt is to bee made touching their goodneſſe.

I ſaw long ſince many ſtones like to it, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were true or adulterate, I know not: But if wee conſult with</hi> Serapio <hi>and</hi> Rhazes, <hi>I ſee not why I ſhould allow of this ſtone to be legitimate.</hi> Where hee inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly confeſſes, that he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bezaar ſtone of the Emperour were true or no, and he rather thinks that it is adulterate.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115445:187"/>kinde of Goat; the other brought out of the Weſt, from <hi>America,</hi> which is found in divers creatures. Concerning which it is to be noted out of <hi>Ioſephus Acoſta,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bezaar is found in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs of certain beaſts.</note> that this ſtone is found in creatures which are called <hi>Vicugnae,</hi> which are a certaine ſort of Coats, as alſo in a beaſt called <hi>Taruga,</hi> and in all thoſe creatures which are proper to the country of <hi>Peru</hi> alone, it is found in their ſtomach and belly, ſometimes but one, ſometimes two or three, and ſometimes more. Now theſe ſtones differ from one another, in magnitude, forme, and colour; for ſome are not bigger than a hazell nut, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are as large as walnuts, pigeons egges, and henne egges, yea ſometimes they are as great as an Orange, as <hi>Acoſta</hi> reports he hath ſeen: The forme like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is diverſe and very different; ſo for colour, ſome are black, others greene, white, of the colour of Gold, grey. Therefore neither the colour, nor the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure can be certaine and infallible ſignes of their goodneſſe. In <hi>Peru</hi> they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of ſeverall ſorts of creatures, both wild and tame, as the <hi>Ganacus, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Vicugna, Taruga,</hi> which creatures he deſcribes; the <hi>Ganaci,</hi> and <hi>Paci.</hi> are a ſort of Rammes, they have but little ſtones,

But the beſt are thoſe that are taken out of the <hi>Tarugae,</hi> they are thick, white of colour tending to grey, having thicker ſhels than the reſt. In new Spaine they are found alſo in Stags.

The ſame have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our moderne Writers obſerved; <hi>Hercules Saxonia,</hi> a famous practitioner among the Italians, doth ingenuouſly confeſſe, that he could never obſerve any remarkable effect of them, although thoſe ſtones which he had, were thought to be the beſt in <hi>Venice.

But I never ſaw any ſweat break forth, or if it did appeare, it was a very imperfect ſweat. Therefore for my owne part, I abandoned all hope of any good by this Stone in feavers; It may bee I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on a ſophiſticate and adulter ate Stone. But when I adminiſtred Phyſick in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemens houſes in Venice, they perſwaded me that they were the moſt excellent of all others.</hi> Notwithſtanding <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and other Phyſicians do commend this Stone, but it is likely they had ſome
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115445:188"/>true ſtones, which are very rare with us; yea, and he himſelfe in his Epiſtle before cited, conreſſes that thoſe ſtones which the Emperour had, were not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but ſophiſticate. <hi>Valleſius,</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that ours are for the moſt part adulterate,
<note place="margin">Its very probable ours are all ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> this is not the leaſt ground for ſuſpition, that they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of creatures that are ſlain and eviſcerated; and it can ſcarce bee that one Country ſhould afford ſo many creatures, but at length the <hi>ſpecies</hi> would become very rare. For ſuch a number of theſe ſtones are in <hi>England</hi> alone, that it ſeemes a wonder to me that they are not more rare. And if we conſider the other Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> we ſhall find abundance of them every where. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the Phyſicians which have practiſed Phyſick among the Indians, doe confeſſe that theſe ſtones are very rare there, and wondrous deare; and that the Indians doe keep them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115445:189"/>for their own uſe: from whence then have we ſuch a continuall ſupply of them in ſuch plenty, if they bee not counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is a very difficult thing, yea I think it altogether impoſſible, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to diſcern the naturall from the artificiall, ſuch a notable craft have ſome of theſe Impoſtors. I ſaw a fellow at <hi>Paris,</hi> who made them ſo cunningly, that he himſelfe could not diſtinguiſh them from the other, but by certaine marks which he ſet on them. <hi>Saxonia</hi> confeſſes that he could never finde an infallible token whereby to know this ſtone. Some ſay there is a tender ſprig of ſome plant in the middle of it, or a little ſand, I have ſeen a pin, <hi>Acoſta</hi> ſaw a ſtraw in one; but theſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like things doe theſe jugglers know how to put into their counterfeit ſtones. <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro,</hi> in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of Womens diſeaſes, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to know them thus. <hi>That which we have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from Eaſt India is the beſt of all others, which is ſmooth, tranſparent, coated like an onion, of a dark green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without taste, the powder whereof, if you mingle with water and chaulk, it yields a pale green colour, and being caſt upon the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115445:189"/>fire, doth preſently vaniſh all into aire.</hi> But neither are theſe things very certaine. Authors write that theſe ſtones are of divers colours, but almoſt all ours are of the ſame colour, ſomewhat blackiſh, but the yellow are ſaid to be the beſt; therefore the moſt excellent are ſeldom found with us, becauſe wee have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome any that are yellow. <hi>Acoſta</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that the Indians doe counterfait them, which is very likely, ſeeing that is uſually done in medicaments of much leſſe price and moment. If any man therefore have a ſtone, which hee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowes to be true and naturall, I am not againſt his uſing of it, if hee hath once experienced the vertues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; only I would advertiſe thus much in this place, that men ſhould not give credit to all ſtones of this kinde, that the true Bezaar is very rare, and which is worſt of all, that there are no ſure and infallible tokens, whereby the true may bee diſtinguiſhed from the falſe. And there are ſtones ſometimes very like to the Bezaar found in divers crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in horſes, ſwine, and others,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>conſil.</hi> 1.</note> which are of no vertue at all. <hi>Andreas Laurentius</hi> commends the Bezaar againſt melancholy, ſo that it be naturall and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115445:190"/>true, not counterfeit and adulterate, ſuch as at this day the pedling Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvers, Mountibanks, Confectioners, as alſo the fraudulent and covetous Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries almoſt throughout all France doe uſually fell, a hundred graines of which counterfeit ſtone can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the leaſt moment of health.</p>

                  <p>I will ſuppoſe in this Chapter, that the true Bezaar is familiarly found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people doe ſo confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. Nevertheleſſe many are very much afraid of the quantity of it, as if it were a very hot, and ſtrong working medicament; and I have often ſeene women, which give the ſick hot reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to comfort them, as cinnamon-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, burnt wine, and the like, to bee notwithſtanding very fearfull of the omantity of this Stone, and to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and thwart a Phyſician, if any time he preſcribe more than two, or at the moſt four graines at once. And indeed reaſon it ſelfe ſeemes to favour their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for they ſay it provokes ſweat. Now ſudorificks doe ſeem to bee hot,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115445:190"/>becauſe they attenuate, and cut tough humours, and expell them to the ſkin. Therefore this Stone ſeemes to bee ſo much the hotter, in that it performes this thing, being exhibited in a ſmall doſe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is to be noted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that this Stone doth feldome provoke ſweat now adayes, as dayly experience ſhewes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if one take a very great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it, he ſhall never perceive that he is any thing hother thereby; which any man that is in health may make triall of in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of them that have written concerning this Stone, ſome would hand it to be temperate, others cold, but none not, for it hath neither taſte, nor ſmell, which were a wonder, if it were ſo nor. It is therefore more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it works by an occult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to wit, in corroborating the heart, and fortifying it againſt the malignity of poyſon: wherefore by the way I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that this Stone is of no force to corroborate, or comfort the heart, as they call it, except there be malignant and venemous humours in the body, and therefore though it doth no hurt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:115445:191"/>to take it, yet it doth no good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they that have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſtone, do not agree touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doſe thereof. <hi>Avenzoar</hi> gave it unto three graines, which is the common doſe, but his Stone was not this Bezaar of ours. But <hi>Matthiolus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it unto ſeven graines at the leaſt, <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> unto thirty graines, and confeſſes that yet more may be taken without any hurt at all. I have heard ſome famous Phyſicians attribute very much to this Stone, who alledged this as the only cauſe why it is not ſo effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, namely, becauſe it is taken in too little quantity. But moreover, I have read that <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> had a dramme of Bezaar, that is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore graines given him, as may be read more at large in <hi>Monardes, Fumanellus, Abra, Conciliator.</hi> Now becauſe as we have ſaid, the right Bezaar is ſeldome found,
<note place="margin">Bezaar on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the rich, and in a large quantity.</note> and that which we have is ſold at too deare a rate, my counſell is, that it be preſcribed only for rich men, and not for others that are not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the charge, and that it bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes admininiſtred in a large doſe, for elſe it will bee altogether unprofitable. Yea, I verily believe it may be ſafely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115445:191"/>to a dramme, it is ſuch a gentle and innocent remedy. <hi>Fumanellus</hi> in his booke of the Plague commends it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dramme, and <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that it is uſually taken in India unto thirtie Graines, <hi>too great a quantity (ſaith he) for although it a have no noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality, yet it is more ſafe to take it in a little quantity.</hi> But if this ſtone be unhurtfull, a great quantitie is likewiſe unhurtfull, as ſome have obſerved. Therefore there is no cauſe to feare to give ſome children three or four graines thereof. For although <hi>Galen</hi> forbids to give children Triacle, yet there is a great difference betweene it and the Bezaar ſtone; for Triacle is a very hot medicament, and conſiſts of divers ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which may injure, and offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the naturall heat of children, whereas Bezaar is not hot, but only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborates and comforts the heart, by an occult, and not a manifeſt qualitie.</p>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115445:192"/>be the prime Antidotes of all, although the Unicornes horne is not ſo common as the Bezaar. Yet many bragge, that they have great pieces of it. But it is a thing doubted of by many not without good reaſon,
<note place="margin">Doubts concerning the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns horn.</note> whether there be any ſuch horne or no. That there are divers ſorts of creatures which have but one horne in their head, the writings both of ancient and moderne Authors doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie. There are foure recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up by <hi>Ariſtotle, Aetian,</hi> and <hi>Plinie: Ariſtotle</hi> names onely the <hi>Oryx,</hi> and the <hi>Indian Aſse;</hi> others to theſe do adde the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> and that which is properly called the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorne,</hi> of which is our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe. But it is not yet mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt what this Unicorne is properly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hitherto it could not bee certainely found out in any Indian voyages. And they that do report that they have ſeen ſuch a creature, doe much differ in their deſcription thereof, as that they ſeem in a manner fables, whatſoever they relate. <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Solinus,</hi> who never ſaw ſuch a creature, do notwithſtanding thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, without doubt from other mens relation;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plinies</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</note> 
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> deſcribes the Unicorne <hi>to be a very fierce beaſt, in other parts of his body like an Horſe, in his head like to a

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive he is not ſubject to man, he may be ſlaine indeed, but cannot be taken.</hi> But <hi>Ludovicus Vartomannus,</hi> a famous writer,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Scaligers</hi> deſcription</note> reports, that hee ſaw two Unicornes in his travailes, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> relates in his 205. Exercitation: The Unicorne (ſaith he) is as bigge as an horſe, hath the legs, feet, and head of a Stagge, his haire of a bay colour, his maine thinner and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an horſes, his hips rough with haire; at <hi>Nice</hi> we ſaw one whole horn, others elſwhere, one of a tawny colour, another yellowiſh, comming near to the colour of box, another of a reddiſh and we have ſome with a white creſt upon them. And hee differs much from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> deſcription; for he ſaith, that hee
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115445:193"/>is a gentle and meek creature, and he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to him the feet and legges of a Stagge; but <hi>Plinie</hi> the feet of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and others in their deſcriptions do vary from theſe. Yet <hi>Amatus</hi> the Portugall in his 52. Narrat. upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> acknowledges, that the Portugall Phyſicians, and others that have travailed through the inland of <hi>India,</hi> doe make no mention of any ſuch creature, ſave that it is held in great account among the Indians againſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<note place="margin">Vnicornes horne is of a blackiſh colour.</note> and peſtilent Fevers. And the ſame <hi>Amatus</hi> notes, that the right Unicornes horne is of a blackiſh colour, or at leaſt of an aſh colour; as alſo that if it be too old it is of no vertue, as it falls out in other medicaments, and likewiſe that there are many counterfeit and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ones, made up of chaulke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things after the form of a horn; and that others do ſell the bone of a Whale for it; yea, and I have heard that Sea-horſe teeth, and Elephants teeth have been taken for it: Theſe things do ſeem to raiſe a doubt touching theſe hornes. But ſome will ſay, the holy Scripture doth in ſundry places make mention of that creature as the moſt fierce of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But perhaps that word which
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115445:193"/>Interpreters have tranſlated Unicorne, is not properly known what it is; for as <hi>Morinus Bleſenſis</hi> a moſt learned Clerke obſerves, the Jews do confeſſe, that they doe not underſtand many of the names of Birds, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> makes mention in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and why may it not as well be, that that word is not underſtood; which nevertheleſſe Interpreters have tranſlated Unicorn in generall. But it is likely that it was not the Rhinoceros; for this beaſt may rather be ſaid to have two horns than but one, and is not nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſlow, having a very ſhort horn, but the hornes of the Unicorne which are brought unto us, are for the moſt part very long, and taken from that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the Scripture ſaith is very nimble; and therefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> blames <hi>Cardanus,</hi> for deſcribing the Unicorne under the name of Rhinoceros, whoſe picture the ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith hee ſaw, namely of that <hi>Whoſe dead carkaſſe was caſt upon the coaſt of</hi> Tuſcanie, <hi>with the head of a Bore, a ſcaly back, two hornes, the one very little in the forehead, the other very ſtrong in the ſnout, wherewith he ſights adventurouſly, and overcomes the Elephant.</hi> And this ſeems to be the very ſame beaſt of which <hi>Amatus</hi> the Portugall made mention, which <hi>Emmanuel</hi> King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:115445:194"/>ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> but the ſhip being caſt away neare unto <hi>Marſeille,</hi> the wild beaſt periſhed in the ſea, the ſkinne whereof the adjoyning borderers brought unto <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> But whether by the name of Unicorne the Indian Aſſe ought to be underſtood, it might perhaps be a doubt, but that <hi>Aelian</hi> hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them. Therefore I doe not ſay that the Unicorne is a fained crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is very rare, and not yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known. But furthermore <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his ſixth book of the French Warre, makes mention of an Oxe that hath but one horne, and there are alſo ſuch in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> as Hiſtorians report. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the earth,
<note place="margin">There are Sea uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes.</note> but the water alſo hath its unicorne Monſters, which perhaps live both in the water, and on the land, as <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> reports of a certaine Monſter that lives both in ſea and land, about the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> which hath but one horne in the forehead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he boldly fights againſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant;
<note place="margin">Two Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes hornes found in the ſand in Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were brought to Hull.</note> ſo likewiſe out of the Northern countries, as out of <hi>Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are brought hornes, which are thought to bee the hornes of Sea-Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns. Not many years agoe, there were brought into this towne of <hi>Hull</hi> (where I write theſe things) out of <hi>Greenland</hi>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:115445:194"/>two heads of Sea-Unicornes that were found upon the ſhore, with large horns in the foreheads, ſome pieces of which I have ſeen. From whence it is evident that there are many creatures which have but one horne, as well in the ſea as on the land. But beſides all this, <hi>Daniel Sennertus</hi> a very late writer, in the fifth booke of his naturall Philoſophy, makes mention of a certain horn that is digged out of the earth,
<note place="margin">Horns dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the earth.</note> which is found in <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringin, Bohemia,</hi> and other places of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which is taken for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes horn, to which they aſcribe a vertue againſt the Epilepſie, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſeaſes, and he teaches to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the naturall, in that the true horne is very hard, but that which is digged up out of the earth is not hard, but is eaſily bruiſed and broken, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to the tongue cleaves to it, like unto <hi>terra ſigillata;</hi> or ſome kind of Marle. Alſo <hi>Geſner, Fallopius, Agricola,</hi> and others that have written of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills have made mention thereof. There are therefore divers forts of Unicornes, but yet they have not all vertue againſt poyſon. And <hi>Aelian</hi> who deſcribes the Unicorne, doth not attribute any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotary facultie thereunto, but onely to the Indian Aſſe; for hee writes that the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115445:195"/>wealthier ſort among the Indians are wont to drinke out of theſe homes, and that whoſoever drinkes out of them is healed of incurable diſeaſes, nor is hee taken with convulſions (ſay they) nor the Falling-ſickneſſe, nor hurt with poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Moreover if hee hath drunke any deadly thing, he vomits it up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to his health againe.

Ambroſius Pareus,</hi> and other moſt famous Phyſicians have found no effect at all of this horne, and he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of that cuſtome of touching the Kings meat with the Unicornes horne; which cuſtome I heare he hath aboliſhed who is the chiefe Phyſician in ordinary to the King of <hi>France.</hi> In like manner <hi>Aelian</hi> attributes to the horne of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Horſe a vertue againſt poyſon, and <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> relates the ſame of the horne of the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> it is but ſhort, very ſtrong, black, ſome ſay that it is within of dark yellow colour, and being wet with the tongue, it yeelds the ſmell of ſome burnt matter. <hi>Garcius</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115445:195"/>of his Monſter at the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> that lives both in the ſea, and on the land, which reſembles a Horſe in ſhape, that the horn thereof is very much commended for a counter-poyſon, an experiment thereof being made on two Dogs, the one of which that had drunk a double quantitie of poyſon, taking the powder of this horne was well againe: but the other which had none given him, dyed preſently, although he had a leſſe quantitie of poyſon given him. So likewiſe the hornes which are brought out of the North countries, and which are digged out of the earth, are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have no ſmall vertue againſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although ſome deny it,
<note place="margin">Thoſe that are digeed out of the earth are the beſt.</note> and theſe are the hornes for the moſt part, which many ſhew for the Unicornes horne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the colour correſponds not, which is black in the true Unicorne. But all that have written of them, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thoſe that bee digged out of the earth, as <hi>Geſner, Ceſalpinus,</hi> and others, for they have an antidotary and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative facultie, and do mightily provoke ſweat, like <hi>Terra Lemnia.</hi> Therefore that I may conclude this Chapter, ſeeing the vertue of theſe Medicaments can be found out no other way but by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence onely, it will bee eaſie for any one

For though it be not knowne from what creatures they are taken, yet their vertue is not to bee denyed, ſeeing the originall of Exoticks hath not yet been fully known. If we allow of Harts horn, why ſhall not other hornes have the ſame vertue, yea there are ſome, that will have a certain whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome qualitie to bee in all hornes, even of Oxen, and therefore the Ancients did drink out of hornes, hence are thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">

Seeing therefore the hornes which are carried about for the Unicornes horne, are diverſe in colour, magnitude, and figure, it is probable that they come from diverſe creatures. Therefore whether it be the horn of the Indian Aſſe, which <hi>Aelian</hi> commends, or of the Rhinoceros, or of ſome water crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is all one, ſo there be experience of the vertue of it. Wherefore I would not curiouſly enquire, whether it be an Unicornes horn, or ſome other creatures, ſo it be good and efficacious, yea and it
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115445:196"/>is no matter whether the creature hath two hornes or but one. Yet it is moſt certaine, as we have ſaid before, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants teeth, and Whale-bones, and Sea-horſe teeth, and common hornes burnt, and thoſe which are digged out of the earth, which we have ſpoken of, and other counterfeit and artificiall hornes,
<note place="margin">Elephants and Sea horſe teeth commonly ſold for Vnicornes hornes.</note> are commonly ſold for the true Unicornes horne. <hi>Cardanus</hi> ſaith that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants teeth may bee made ſo pliable by art, that they may be made ſtreight like hornes, and ſo ſet out for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes horn. <hi>Neither give eare to them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Amatus</hi> the Portugall) <hi>who when they goe about to try an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicornes horn, do infuſe the ſcrapings and powder thereof in water, which they ſay forthwith is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and bubbles up, for you may perceive the ſame to happen from the ſcrapings of any bone infuſed in water, as you may make triall in Ivory.</hi> So likewiſe we muſt take heed that wee doe not give credit to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch experiments, which ſome uſe to prove the goodneſſe of the Unicornes horne; for they ſay that if poyſon, or ſome venomous creature be neare unto it, it ſweats, as if it did ſuffer, and were affected with the poyſon; as alſo they bid make a circle of the powder of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115445:197"/>the middle of which, or into an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low horn they put a ſpider, which if ſhe paſſe over they will have it to bee a counterfeit horn; but if ſhe burſt and die, it is naturall, all which are falſe: but enough of this.</p>

But Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um is now brought into uſe, the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layd aſide. Yet the people doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre from the uſe thereof, and avoyd
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:115445:207"/>it as preſent poyſon,
<note place="margin">Opium in the hand of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician is a harmleſſe thing.</note> when notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being rightly prepared, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in a convenient doſe, it is a very harmleſſe and wholſome medicament. The Ancient indeed thought it to bee poyſon, but that is onely when it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in too great a quantity. But thus nothing is ſo wholſome, which by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt uſe may not become hurtfull, and nothing ſo hurtfull which may not bee made wholſome. Now there are divers ſorts of poyſons,
<note place="margin">Divers ſorts of poyſons.</note> ſome are poyſons in their whole ſubſtance, which can doe the body no good, after what manner ſoever they be taken; although they be given in ſo ſmall a doſe, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kill, as Arſenick. But the nature of others is contrary and different from theſe, in that they doe not hurt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but in a certaine quantitie, otherwiſe they may doe much good to the body, ſuch is all Phyſick, eſpecially purging medicines. For whatſoever is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in ſuch a quantitie, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes nature, it doth aſſume the nature of poyſon, thus milke curdled in the ſtomach, and the juice of Lettice, are thought to be poyſonous, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe may do good to mans body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly and moderately uſed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115445:208"/>we find in hiſtory of certain maids that have fed upon Monkes-hood, and Hemlock. But it is to be noted, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe things which cauſe ſleep, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium is the moſt innocent for divers cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that Opium which wee uſe, is for the moſt part, <hi>Meconium of Dioſcorides,</hi> which is made of the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned juice of the leaves and heads of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but the right Opium is a
<note n="*" place="margin">Or gum.</note> 
                     <hi>Lachryma.</hi> Now <hi>Meconium</hi> is far weaker according to <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> than Opium, and <hi>Matthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in his Epiſtles is of the ſame opinion likewiſe. Wherefore if it hurt, it muſt bee adminiſtred in a greater doſe than Opium. And <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium taken in the bigneſſe of a Vetch doth aſſwage pain, concoct, and provoke ſleep, but if it be taken in a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, it doth harm. And he writes of one <hi>Mneſidemus</hi> who approved of the uſe thereof onely in ſmell, becauſe it would ſo procure ſleep, but diſallowed it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as hurtfull; but <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> addes, <hi>Experience ſhewes that theſe are but idle fictions, for the effects of the vertues of this medicament do beget credit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be noted according to <hi>Galen,</hi> that there are divers ſorts of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115445:208"/>for ſome do moiſten, others dry,
<note place="margin">Moyſt narcoticks are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> thoſe which doe moiſten, as Hemlock, Mandrake, &amp; the like are hurtfull, as alſo thoſe that are poyſonous in their whole ſubſtance, as ſleepy nightſhade, which things are never wont to bee uſed by Phyſicians to provoke ſleep. But thoſe things that are taken inwardly without harm to the body, ought to have a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualitie, as * <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth,
<note place="margin">5. Simpl. 18</note> where he ſaith, thoſe things which cauſe ſleep do refrigerate the body, and drying me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are the fitteſt for that intention. And in his firſt booke of the cauſes of diſeaſes, he ſaith, that thoſe things which do refrigerate and moyſten do not cauſe a ſweet ſleep, but a long and dead ſleep, and ſtupefaction; but thoſe that are of a drying qualitie, as Opium, are not ſo hurtfull. Therefore according to the judgement of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> Opium moderately taken, is not ſo much to be feared. Beſides many compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are to bee ſold in ſhops have Opium in them, as Triacle, Mithridate, <hi>Dioſcordium, Philonium,</hi> and the ancient Phyſicians were wont to put it into al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all their Antidotes, and they uſed it familiarly in divers diſeaſes, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they made uſe of worſe than it.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115445:209"/>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 2. <hi>de morbis,</hi> uſes Henbane, and Mandrake for a Quartane Ague. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> for the ſame purpoſe preſcribes O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium with an equall quantity of Myrrh, Pepper, and Caſtoreum. But wee now adayes doe with more ſecuritie uſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium, better prepared, and corrected by chymicall Extractions, as <hi>Landanum,</hi> two or three Grains of which, or at the moſt foure, are a ſufficient doſe, where notwithſtanding there is not ſo much as one graine of Opium, although it be rightly prepared.
<note place="margin">Opium the ſame with Meconium of Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</note> Seeing then our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um is for, the moſt part no other then <hi>Meconium:</hi> of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> which is farre more ſlow in operation then Opium, and therefore may be preſeribed in a greater quantitie, the quantity of one or two grains can do no harm. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Opium to the bigneſſe of a Vetch, whereas we give a pill of <hi>Laudanum</hi> to the bigneſſe of a Vetch, a third part whereof is not <hi>Meconium.</hi> I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Opium ſhould be ſo much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

                  <p>AMong topicall remedies, the uſe of fomentations is of great eſteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Phyſicians, which are made of ſome kinde of liquor, that is applyed to the parts of the body for divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as to heat them, open obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, diſſolve hard tumours, aſſwage paine, and to digeſt and diſcuſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Now they are made of ſome convenient liquor, eſpecially of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of many ſimples, or of oyle, milk, and the like; which liquor many put into a bladder, leſt the linnen of their bed be wet therewith, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward would be very tedious and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the ſick. But thus the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid preparation, to wit, the mixture and decoction of the divers ſimples is made unprofitable: For their vertue
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115445:211"/>doth not penetrate through the bladder into the body, but only the heat works, ſo that if ſome part ſtand in need of heating only, the fomentation may be made with a bladder, what liquor ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be put therein. Alſo if there bee need to aſſwage paine, and digeſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, heat by its owne quality will effect it.

                  </head>
                  <p>NOt only the common people, but alſo very many Phyſicians, have uſed to lay to the ſoles of the feet young pigeons, or whelps cloven through the middle of the back, which cuſtome I doe not in this place ſpeak againſt, for I know it hath beene oftentimes done, to the exceeding great commodity of the ſick. But becauſe they are very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wont to be applyed to the head, we will treat a little in this Chapter of this ſubject. For the Ancients,
<note place="margin">The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were wont to apply them to the head.</note> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moderne Writers, do often preſcribe them to be applyed to the head, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never to the feet. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is ordinarily uſed in the diſeaſes of the braine, as the frenſie, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now the frenſie is an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the brain, or its membranes, the manner of curing whereof,
<note place="margin">The cure of the frenſie.</note> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of Phyſicians, is this: that in the beginning the Phyſician uſe all kinds of revulſions, and diverting reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and appy to the head thoſe things that have power to repell, and drive back the hot humours from the head.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:115445:212"/>But if by theſe meanes the diſeaſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured, then in the increaſe and height of the diſeaſe, he muſt proceed to reſolving remedies, which during the increaſe may be firſt mixed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling; but in the height of the diſeaſe they muſt bee meerly reſolving medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.

<note place="margin">8 <hi>collect. cap.</hi> 19.</note> And * <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius</hi> is of the ſame minde. For they draw by their heate and paine. But young pigeons do reſolve without much heat; wherefore though I thinke they doe draw ſomething, yet it is but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not from the far diſtant parts, in reſpect of their ſo gentle heat. Nor

<note place="margin">A princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient is the moſſe that grows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans skull that was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> (which they call <hi>uſnea</hi>) becauſe this is as it were the pure quinteſſence of the ſkull, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous ſubſtance, as one of them better learned than the reſt was conceited. <hi>Crollius</hi> makes choice of a man that hath dyed a violent death, and <hi>Hartman</hi> his Commentatour preferres one that hath been hanged. <hi>Becauſe when they are ſtrangled, the naturall and vitall ſpirits are carried upwards; and ſeeing that by reaſon of the hardneſse of the skull, they cannot get out, they are coarcted together with the animall ſpirits, and in proceſſe of time grow into one, and breake forth unto the circumference of the skull, then by the acceſſe of Mercury, or the ſpirit of the World, conveyed into theſe inferiour things
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115445:214"/>by raine, dew, ſnow, and frosts, is made uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, which containes in it all the naturall, vitall, and animall vertues, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it communicates to this oyntment.</hi> Who can but admire at ſuch groſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of naturall Philoſophy in <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi> For he is in a palpable errour, in ſaying that in them that are ſtrangled, the naturall and vitall ſpirits are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upwards, when the veſſels, to wit, the veines and arteries through which theſe ſpirits are carried, as all men know, are intercepted and ſtopped. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, although they ſhould be carried up then more than at other times, why ſhall they rather be coarcted and united in one that is hanged, than in a living man, in whom the ſpirits are ſo eaſily waſted, and how is it that before this moſſe and hearineſſe grew upon the ſkull, they are not quite diſſipated and diſſolved? But how knowes hee that thoſe ſpirits are carried up to the braine, in them that are hanged, doe ſettle rather in the ſkull, than in the ſubſtance of the brain? For in a living creature they are for the moſt part in the braine it ſelfe. Now theſe ſpirits doe either flow into it, or they are naturally ſeated and placed there. If they doe only flow thither, it is moſt cartaine that they doe all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:115445:215"/>after death, becauſe they are not parts of the body, nor are they kept in by the ſtrength of the living body, for it is alſo conſumed and waſted. Hence even in the living there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually need of a freſh ſupply of ſpirits, becauſe ſuch abundance of them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: Much more when the corpſe is rotten, perhaps ſome yeares, before the ſkull is made quite bare, and is fit to contract moſſineſſe. That they are not inſite and naturally placed there, it is evident, becauſe then they ſhould be immoveable; but theſe ſpirits in the very act of ſuffocation are preſently lifted up to the brain. Nor is it a thing credible, that after death, or in death they are ſeated there, (which <hi>Hartman</hi> ſeemes to have meant, when hee ſaith, that in proceſſe of time they grow into one) for thoſe ſpirits that are infite by nature, are made, or at leaſt repaired, and maintained by thoſe that flow into the braine, by an act of nouriſhment, which is not in them that are hanged, and though it were in them, yet it ſhould be rather in the braine, than in the ſkull. Beſides the ſubſtance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is very thin, and apt to evaporate; how is it therefore, when they breake
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115445:215"/>out unto the circumference of the ſkull, and are no longer encloſed within its hardneſſe, that they doe not vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but turn into a groſſe and filthy moſſe? Their ſpirituall ſubſtance will nor endure that. And therefore it is manifeſt that he erred, in ſaying that this moſſe containes in it all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the body, it is a wonder that it hath not alſo nouriſhment, ſobſet, and reaſon. I waved that which he babbles concerning the ſpirit of the World, which he calls <hi>Mercuriu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> But I had almoſt forgotten, that of this moſſe, the foundation of ſuch an excellent remedy, <hi>Crollius</hi> mixes in his oyntment but the weight of two hazell nuts, which is (as <hi>Hartman</hi> interprets) one dramme; but <hi>Paracelſus</hi> deemed two vounces lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough, although <hi>Paracolſus</hi> his whole deſcription is but of nine oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but <hi>Crollius</hi> his deſcription is of thirteene ounces, ſo large a ſtructure

                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is to be noted, that in the oyntment, according to <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his deſcription, there was the bloud and fat of a man; but <hi>Crollius</hi> omits them, and not amiſſe, if the moſs by it ſelfe have all the vertues in it, which thing <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſeemes not to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, in that he added theſe unto it, but in defect of them hee puts therein the fat of a pig, a bore, and a beare. And <hi>Hartman</hi> gives the reaſon why <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> did adde bloud thereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although the ſpirits do vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet thoſe ſpirits which adhere to the ſalt of the bloud, are retained. But firſt hee thought it requiſite that thoſe ſpirits ſhould be carried up to the ſkull, whereas <hi>Crollius</hi> thought them to be altogether unprofitable. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Crollius</hi> doe adde thereunto Mummy, by which my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Hartman</hi> thinks is meant Egyptian Mummie. Which nevertheleſſe is the moſt unprofitable remedy, being made in <hi>Egypt</hi> by couſening fellowes, of the fleſh of elephantick and leprous perſons, and of ſuch as dyed of the French Pox, or ſome ſuch filthy diſeaſes, and of the fleſh of ſlaves which they buy, which
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:115445:216"/>they enbalme with Pitch and Bitumen. But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doth in ſundry places highly extoll <hi>Mummie of the Gallowes,</hi> as he calls it, that is to ſay, the fleſh of a man that was hanged, the which it is probable <hi>Crollius</hi> meant, becauſe he left out the fat and blood of a man, which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> did put in. Then other ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are added, ſuch as may be inſerted in other ointments and plaiſters; for <hi>Paracelſus</hi> added thereunto Lineſeed oyle, oyle of Roſes, and Bole-armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack; And <hi>Crollius</hi> earth-wormes waſhes, the braine of a Bore, redde Sanders, and the blood-ſtone.
<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</note> Here the reader muſt conſider, that theſe are two ſeverall kindes of ointments really differing, and have nothing common but the Moſſe, which <hi>Crollius</hi> added but in a very ſmall quantitie, and yet theſe two ointments are both of them ſaid to bee of the ſame efficacie, although <hi>Crollius</hi> left out thoſe things to which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſians do attribute the whole mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall vertue: Yea ſome have left out the very Moſſe alſo.</p>

                     <hi>Seventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Crollius</hi> would have it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, whether it be a deep prick or no, for then the weapon muſt bee anointed upwards, and not by deſcending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, although <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſeemes not to have regarded that, who commended the onely dipping of the weapon into the ointment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> it is to bee noted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> that in a manner all the examples of cures which they inſtance, are only of ſimple wounds in the fleſh, in which there is no loſſe of ſubſtance at all, but onely one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to wit, a conjoyning of the parts diſunited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ſome render this reaſon of the effect, to wit, that there are ſpirits in the blood, and in regard of the familiaritie and ſympathy of mans ſpirits among themſelves, the ointment is made of mans blood, fat, and fleſh, and the moſſe of the ſkull, in which ſpirits are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Hence it comes to paſſe, that when the blood of the party wounded is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the ointment, the ſpirits that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:115445:218"/>are in the blood, are by reaſon of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy joyned with the ſpirits of the ointment, being both of the ſame kind, and ſo doth take the vertues of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and carry it unto the party woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And not only the vertues of the ointment, but alſo the affects which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the adminiſtration of ointments, which are ſuch as happen either by a too ſtrait, or too looſe ligature, as alſo thoſe which may enſue, if a wound be left uncovered in a place that is either too cold or too hot. And there is ſo much force in theſe ſpirits, that they are able to conveigh the vertue of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Eaſt into the Weſt, from the North to the South. And <hi>Crollius</hi> calls them all fooles, who think that this cure is Magicall, and hee will have it to be done by a magneticall, and attractive vertue, cauſed by the ſtarres, which is carried unto the wound by the Aire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Medium,</hi> and that by reaſon of the ſympathy of Nature and Balſame of bloud, which is in every man, and by reaſon of the influence of caeleſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And thus <hi>Hartman</hi> explaines it, when the weapon is anointed, the ſalt of the blood which is on the weapon doth by a magneticall vertue draw the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:115445:218"/>animal ſpirits out of the ointment, which two ſpirits by the concurrence of the ſpirit of the world, are friendly united into one. But if the ſpirit which is in the bloud of the weapon cannot attract the ſpirit of the ointment without the annointing, that is to ſay without reall contract, how can it bee ſayd to draw it with a magneticall vertue? Now this ſpirit of the world hee will have to bee diffuſed throughout all things in the world, to be that which carries the formes of ſeeds, and all proportions, which knits all things together, and which applies actives to paſſives. Hence it comes to paſſe, that what commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or diſcommoditie that bloud congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without the veines doth receive, it is preſently by ſympathy communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its connaturall blood that reſides within the veines. Thence it is that the partie is in paine if the weapon bee held to the fire, or expoſed to the cold aire, and contrariwiſe if the patient chance to eat Onions, Muſtard, or Garlick, it may preſently be perceived in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, namely, becauſe thoſe ſpirits doe communicate their paſſions one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been premiſed, it will be very eaſie to demonſtrate the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115445:219"/>of that manner of curing,
<note place="margin">The vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of which I confeſſe, I never did, nor yet deſire to make any tryall. Yet I doubt not, but I ſhall plainly ſhew the frivolouſneſſe of it, even from their own principles. For inſtead of the ground-worke, they lay downe many things that are very dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertaine, as that which <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> talkes of the ſpirit of the world, which, what, or where it is no man as yet hath been able to demonſtrate, which (ſaith hee) is diffuſed throughout all things, when but a little before hee had ſaid, that it is conveighed into theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things by raine, dewes, and froſts, and ſo in a clear and caime aire this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be to ſeek, when perhaps there would be moſt need of it. And leſt we ſhould conceive it to be a ſpirituall and incorporcall ſubſtance, he calls it <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Mundi,</hi> and queſtionleſſe it muſt be corporcall, which ſtands in need of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal means to carry it: alſo he ſuppoſes the ſpirits to be perpetual, and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the bloud although it be corrupted when notwithſtanding the blood even in the body and veins may be ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it may loſe its form, much more without the veines, and doubtleſſe the bloud that is in the ointment, hath quite Joſt its form, &amp; the efficacie of its ſpirits;
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:115445:219"/>and ſo the analogie and ſympathie of the ſpirits of the partie wounded, and of the ointment, is much weakened. Now that ſome do call this a magicall forme of curing it is not improbable,
<note place="margin">Probable arguments to prove it magicall.</note> ſeeing that vertue of curing, which is ſayd to be in the ointment, doth ſtand in need of the ſpirit of the world to carry it, that is to ſay, the Divell, who is called the Prince of the world. But I rather thinke this manner of curing is falſe than magicall, becauſe many follow it, which are very farre from that impious and deteſtable crime. Nor matters it that experience confirmes the truth of this form of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; for onely ſuch wounds have been healed, which might have been healed by natures endeavour alone, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny help of Art, and therefore it may yet be queſtionable, whether the cure were performed by vertue of the ointment or no, as we ſhall manifeſt afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> then it is falſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that this oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a more ſpeciall gift of God than other ointments &amp; remedies are,
<note place="margin">Its not a ſpecial gift of God as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> ſeeing by their own confeſſion the whole cure is done by naturall means. We muſt needs confeſſe, that every thing is the gift of God; whatſoever, we eat, drinke, or uſe for the health of mans body. But in this
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115445:220"/>ſence they call it not the gift of God, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> becauſe God hath miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly taught it men, as if every Science, Art, and all knowledge of remedies were not from God, who hath created Medicine out of the earth. But let us ſee whether this cure be poſſible or no. That there are great and divers ſympathies, and antipathies of things, experience it ſelfe ſhewes, the reaſons whereof it is impoſſble to render. Yet all things are contained and terminated within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpheare of activitie. Wee dayly ſee that the Loadſtone drawes not iron, but within a certaine diſtance. I knew one that could not endure Cat to be in the roome, although he ſaw her not, but being put out of the chamber, with a wall or doore between, hee returned to himſelf again; and ſo of all others. There is no ſtronger antipathy then that which is betwixt the heavens and theſe inferiour things, becauſe it comprehends all things within its circumference, and being of great force to act, is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late its qualities and vertues every way, ſo that this inferiour orbe, and every parcell thereof, is within the ſpheare of the activitie of thoſe caeleſtiall bodies; yet we ſee that ſympathy to languiſh by
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:115445:220"/>the diſtance of places. The Loadſtone tends to the Pole Artick, but the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is from the Pole, the more it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines from it, and ſo by little and little it tends not to the Poles of the world, but to the Zodiack, and perhaps rather to ſome other part of the heavens then to the North. If this bee true of the Caeleſtiall bodies, it muſt needs be more true of theſe inferiour things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how can the vertue of that oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be carried ſo farre, as ſometimes it muſt be, and not bee hindred by the interpoſition of buildings, ſeas, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, walls, windes, and of the cheſt in which with the weapon it is layd up, eſpecially when thoſe things which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſpirits are corporeall, which may be letted by the interpoſition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodyes; or at leaſt by how much the further diſtant the object is, by ſo much the more is the vertue thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, and there is good cauſe to fear, leſt in a great diſtance of places, the force of the medicament doe periſh quite. <hi>Hartman</hi> writes, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is made by a magneticall vertue, even ſo as the ſent of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe is communicated to the Vultures many miles diſtant. But ſmels are not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:115445:221"/>diffuſed in any unlimited ſpace whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and beſides they may be diverſly hindred, as by raine, windes, and ſuch like. To no purpoſe alſo was it, that <hi>Goclenius</hi> alledged exampies of many ſympathies; for it followes not becauſe there are ſympathies in other things, that therefore there is a ſympathy in the ointment. Beſides the ſympathy which is ſayd to bee in this ointment, is farre different from the ſympathy of other things, which do inſenſibly diffuſe their vertue into the aire, and need not the ſpirit of the world to carry them, and do never worke unleſſe the object bee preſent, and are terminated and limited within a certain ſpace. But that there are ſome <hi>ceſſations and fallings off</hi> from this ſympathy the Loadſtone ſhewes, which being rubbed over with Garlick, doth not draw iron, which manifeſts, that there is not an efflux and waſting of the qualitie only, but of ſome thinne ſubſtance alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is not a reall contact of the agent and patient, for it touches not the wound it ſelf, but the weapon which is farre diſtant from the wound, which is neither the ſubject of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, nor yet of the cure, and which
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:115445:221"/>needs not to be cured. Therefore one ſaid well, hee that bindes the weapon that the wound may be cured, doth as if one ſhould cover a ſtone, which hath made the hand cold, that the hand may be made hot thereby. Nor let any man ſay that there is a vertuall contract, the ſpirit of the world carrying the vertue of the ointment to the wound; for this ſpirit of the world, if there be any ſuch thing, is common to all things that are in the world; otherwiſe it were not the ſpirit of the world. And yet it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not in other ſympathies; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the object bee preſent, there are none at all. Moreover this ſympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall vertue of the ointment, which is joyned with the ſpirit of the world in ſuch a friendly ſociety, is not ſeated in any artificiall thing, as artificiall, but in ſomething that is naturall, and they might do well to tell what is that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thing in the ointment, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly hath ſo much familiarity with the ſpirit of the world. As wee Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſay, that in every organe there is ſome particular part, which is the ſeat of the facultie, and on which eſpecially depends the action: without doubt there ought to be the ſame thing in this
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:115445:222"/>ointment, for all the ſimples which are put into the compoſition of it, cannot ſo equally agree with the ſpirit of the world, that it ſhould carry their vertues from place to place, at the will of him that annointed therewith. Therefore the cure ſhall reſult either from the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the weapon to the wound, but that cannot be; for in relations there is no power of acting, but there ſhould rather be antipathy betwixt the weapon and the perſon wounded: Or elſe ſome vertue flowes from the ointment to the wound; (for according to <hi>Crollius</hi> the ointment is of a conglutinating and drawing nature) but they do not touch one another. Nor is that ſympathy of nature ſufficient, which <hi>Crollius</hi> with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Balſame makes the cauſe of the cure; for if there be any ſuch ſympathy, the annointing is ſuperfluous; for the vertues which are carried after a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall manner, through ſo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of places, doe not need a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall application. But in this ointment the contrary is apparent; for nothing is done without the anointing of the weapon: Therefore its working is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, and after the manner of other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, it cannot operate without a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:115445:222"/>contact, as appeares by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing; for if it may worke magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically without a corporeall contact, the anointing is in vaine. And in vain alſo doth <hi>Grollius</hi> obſerve a forme of anointing, on the upper or neather part of the weapon, for the vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vertue thereof might out of the box wherein it is, bee diffuſed even to all that are wounded, for it hath a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with all. Seeing then it doth not operate without reall application, and a certaine and determinate manner of anointing, it is plainly manifeſt, that it can act only after the manner of other remedies, upon that thing to which it is applyed, and no further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> why is bloud, fat,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the moſſe of mans bones put into this ointment, is it becauſe the ſpirits which are thought to bee in them, although putrified? But there are more ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the body, than in the ointment, or in the bloud that comes from the wounded. Therefore it is either the vertue of the oyntment that cures, or elſe the vertue of the ſpirit that carries it. If the vertue of the oyntment be the cauſe of the cure, it muſt be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſeated either in the fat, bloud, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115445:223"/>moſſe, or elſe in the other naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which are ingredients alſo in the oyntment, to wit, oyles and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If the vertue of the oyntment depend upon the former, the ointment is unprofitable, becauſe in the body of the party wounded, there is already both a greater plenty of them, and they are of a more forcible operation. But if it flow from the other ſimples, which are put into the compoſition of the oyntment, the former things, to wit, the bloud, fat, and moſſe, are added but in vaine, becauſe they give no vertue to the oyntment. So any vulnerary remedy, if the bloud of the perſon wounded be applyed thereunto, ſhall bee able to cure the wound by a magneticall quality, to wit, the ſpirit conveying the vertue of the oyntment to the part affected. And indeed there is no reaſon, if this ſympatheticall ouring bee naturally poſſible, why it may not bee good in all oyntments, that moſſe and bloud be put into them, not for their vertue of healing, but for their ſympathy only; as, if a wound be to be deterged, take the bloud of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, to which adde a deterging oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſpirits which are in the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:115445:223"/>bloud, by reaſon of ſympathy, by means of the ſpirit of the World, will carry the vertue of that oyntment to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wounded, and ſo performe the cure. In like manner any remedy may be made ſympatheticall; thus purges may be inſtituted, or other intentions of Phyſicians perfected, by adding to ſome convenient remedy a little of the Patients bloud, whoſe vertue may be afterwards carried to the ſick, by means of the ſpirit of the World. But if the ſpirits themſelves have in them the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of curing, ſeeing there are more ſpirits left behinde in the body, in vaine is the vertue of the oyntment implored.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it appeares from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that this is an unprofitable manner of curing. For they ſay, that from the too looſe, or too ſtrait bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the weapon, the ſame ſymptomes doe happen in the ſick, which are wont to come by ſuch tying, when it is uſed to the body. Now theſe ſymptomes doe proceed either from the oyntment, or from the binding. Not from the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it hath power to heale, but not to hurt. Nor from the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe an artificiall thing hath
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:115445:224"/>no power to work at diſtance, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another ſubject then to which it is applyed. And therefore becauſe <hi>Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> preſcribes ſundry formes of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the oyntment is to be ſubſpected; for in naturall things, that curious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of anointing cannot change the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and of beneficiall, make it to become hurtfull, as likewiſe appeares in the Loadſtone. Nor doth it depend on them both, becauſe the magneticall vertue of the oyntment, ſeeing it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be meerly naturall, and is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the oyntment, doth proceed from meanes that work naturally, as are the ſimples of which it is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not from artificiall meanes, which depend meerely on the will of him that anoints with it. Furthermore they ſay, that whatſoever commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or diſcommodity, that ſpirit which is in the bloud of the weapon doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it communicates the ſame by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to that which is in the veines, thence it is that the Patient is in pain, if the weapon bee expoſed the heat of the fire, or to the cold aire. But thus not only the vulnerary vertue of the oyntment, but alſo the externall cold ſhall have a magnetick quality, which
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:115445:224"/>is an abſurd thing to ſuppoſe. So that noxious cold might be carried from the weapon to the Patient through a hot <hi>medium,</hi> as in the greateſt heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. As if the weapon ſhould bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed in a Northern Country, and the Patient be in Africk in a hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſuppoſe the weapon to bee cold, the Patient likewiſe ſhall be cold in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick, yea perhaps being near the ſire. Now ſeeing that cannot bee done but by the aire, as <hi>Crollius</hi> confeſſes, the aire of the Northerne Countrey ſhall have power to refrigerate the aire in <hi>Africa,</hi> which who ſees not to be a groſſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity? But I would demand further, ſeeing there is ſuch a mutuall ſympathy of ſpirits, and the maintainers of this magneticall cure write, that on the contrary, if the ſick ſhall obſerve an ill dyet, and eat garlick, onyons, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, it is preſently diſcerned in the weapon: If the Patient doe lye neare the fire in Africk very hot, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon be expoſed to the cold aire in the Northern Countryes, why ſhall rather the perſon wounded bee made cold, than the weapon be made hot, becauſe they will have the ſpirits to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their paſſions one to another.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:115445:225"/>Theſe externall accidents, cooling, or heating, do happen to the ſpirits either from the oyntment, or not. If not, then they will not affect the party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the oyntment is neceſſary for the magneticall vertue that is in it, and not in the ambient aire, or other externall things, and through the oyntment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the communication of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from the weapon to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor from the oyntment, for it hath neither power to coole nor heat; they are therefore nothing elſe but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things, not permanent, but are changed according to the alteration of the ambient aire, for in a hot aire, the weapon being well covered and bound, both the ſpirits and the oyntment will be hot, and the contrary. Then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand how it comes to paſſe, that they are not againe refrigerated in the way by the aire, for they may bee carried through ſuch ſuch a <hi>medium</hi> which is cold, as the winds which are by nature cold, paſſing through hot climates, doe become bot, as the South winds. In like manner if one looſe a few ounces of bloud by a wound, or bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or bleeding, or by ſome other me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es, it is a woulder, that bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:115445:225"/>changed and cooled, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth not feele ſuch effects, if there be ſuch a great ſympathy of the ſpirits among themſelves, that what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities or inconveniences they receive from externall cauſes, they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to that within the veines; and ſo thoſe ſpirits being refrigerated, have power to refrigerate and coole that body out of which they iſſued. If one or two drops of the bloud on the weapon, by the anointing of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be of power to heat the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded body, if it be kept in a hot place, by reaſon that the ſpirits themſelves are hot, it is a wonder that the reſt of the bloud that was ſpilled, which hath more ſpirits than this, being left behind, and expoſed to the open aire, doth not likewiſe at the ſame time refrigerate the body, ſeeing that in a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity there is alwayes greater vertue; if that bloud be caſt into the fire, why ſhall not the Patient feele the heat of the fire; or if that bloud be putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how is it that the body alſo doth not putrifie, if there be ſuch a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity betwixt the ſpirits, and the body out of which they iſſued? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if the weapon cannot be had, they
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:115445:226"/>ſay it ſufficeth to beſmear another wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, or a willow ſtick, with a drop or two of the bloud that comes out of the wound: I demand therefore, if when this <hi>viceweapon</hi> is anointed with the oyntment, that weapon which made the wound, be firſt caſt into the fire, or water, why ſhall not the ſick be in great paine, be cold, or hot? For there is no reaſon why it ſhould ſuffer rather from one part of the ſpirits than another. It is abſurd therefore to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that this heating or cooling is communicated by any magneticall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Hence the Reader may obſerve, that whatſoever they ſay of the ſympathy of the ſpirits among themſelves, is true with them only of that part of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which they faine to be united with the ſpirits of the oyntment by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anointing, and all theſe ſymptomes, whether good or evill, which they ſay doe happen to the wounded, doe ariſe from thence; But the ſpirits which are in the remainder of the bloud that was ſpilled, doe neither hurt nor good, and ſo their ſympathy is vaniſhed, when nevertheleſſe they are of the ſamekind with the other ſpirits. And who can but thinke theſe things are magicall,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:115445:226"/>eſpecially if the actions of Magicians be compared therewith.

Who can beleeve that this is done by naturall cauſes, and yet it is as eaſie in this to have recourſe to magnetical vertues, and ſympathies, and the ſpirit of the World, as in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-ſalve. Here are examples of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall cures at diſtance, which are in all reſpects like to the anointing of the weapon; for as the image is anointed and bound up for the curing of the wound, ſo is the weapon; and as the Image laid to the fire, or expoſed to the froſt, doth burn, or congeale him that is abſent; ſo doth the unguent laid upon the weapon, and as the King of Scots in <hi>Boëtius</hi> was almoſt conſumed in the waxen Image, ſo the ſame may eaſily, from the anointing of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, happen to him that is wounded,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:115445:227"/>if he that annoints, it, doe malitiouſly lay it to the fire, or in ſome place that may communicate its harme to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wounded, and who ſees not that this may be alſo a ſort of Witchcraft? If he that doth this by the help of the image douſe the Devill (who is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world) as an inſtrument to ſet on the charm, it is likely, that this magneticall cure (as they call it) hath the very ſame Author, which they call by this name, that they may cloak their knavery, with a ſeeming ſhew of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall actions. And deſervedly may the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie be ſuſpected, even becauſe of the Authors of it, who were ſuſpected for Magick. For <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Crollius</hi> do in divers places commend Magick, and will have it to be a thing very needfull for a Phyſician.

The bloud hath the vertue either in it ſelfe, or from the ointment: If in it ſelfe, then is the ointment in vaine. Not from the ointment, becauſe what ſympathy with the ſpirits of the partie is attributed unto it, it hath it from the blood, fleſh, fat, and moſſe, which are ingredients in the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of the ſpirits which are thought to bee in them, it followes then that the ointment hath no vertues in it, which did not lie before in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſo we conclude that the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in vain alſo.</p>

If they be of a diverſe nature among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without doubt they are alſo of different operation, and have not the ſame manner of ſympathy with all the parts, but the ſpirits of bloud, have a greater affinitie with the blood, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of fleſh with the fleſh, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Moſſe with the Skull. And therefore that the cure may ſucceed the better, and ſympathy be preſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the blood of the perſon wounded, both his fat and his bones ought to bee mixed with the ointment on the wepon, that a compleat cure may be performed, and the magneticall vertue be without faile carried to the affected parts; for verily there is not the ſame ſympathy in the aforeſaid ſpirits. But if thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be all of the ſame nature, that curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie in adding thereto blood, fat, fleſh, and moſſe, is in vaine, and ſuperfluous, when onely the blood, which containes in it all thoſe ſpirits may ſuffice.</p>

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115445:229"/>liniment is not rather applyed to the ſick himſelfe, why it cures not ulcers, ſeeing every wound doth at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an ulcer, and ſeeing bloud may flow alſo from ulcers, and the principall indications of a wound, are found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in an ulcer: Why is it not alſo uſed for the curing of wounds made by Piſtoll-ſhot, and for ſuch wherein there is a loſſe of ſubſtance? Why hath <hi>Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> excepted the wounds of the Nerves, Arteries, and principall Members? It is becauſe it is good onely for fimple wounds, and ſuch as are onely in the fleſh, which nature by binding alone doth conglutinate, with the help of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Balſame, that is to ſay, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heate of the body; hence it is eaſie for the wound being wrapped every day in clean clothes, and waſhed with warm urine, to grow together again of it ſelf, without the uſe of any ointment at all. Therefore that ointment is altogether unprofitable, nor availes that any thing which they talk of experience; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt thoſe wounds might have been eured without the ointment. For that ointment doth neither diſſolve, nor purge away the excrements of the wounds, nor preſerve the temperature

                  <p>That this is naturall, I thinke ſcarce any will believe. For whatſoever is naturall, doth depend on inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and may be done by every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall of that kinde, ſo it be entire, ſound, and according to nature in every reſpect, as all Rubarb parges choler, and every man is riſible. Nor doth it depend on number, for number accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Philoſophers is of no force to act, for actions are of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:115445:231"/>and doe depend on the formes of things. But this ſeventh Son is ſaid to have ſome peculiar power, which is denied to the ſix former brethren, to wit, becauſe he is the <hi>Seventh.</hi> It muſt needs follow therefore, that that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt ariſe ſome other way, ſince it proceeds neither from the forme, nor the number. It depends not on the Touch, for Touching as Touching hath onely the power of Touching. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if there be either any noxious or ſalutiferous quality in the body, it is communicated by the Touch. But the Touch it ſelf hath no ſuch force. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſeeing that all diſeaſes are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely by the taking away of their cauſe; thoſe <hi>Wondermongers</hi> cannot take away the Kings evill, unleſſe they firſt take away the cauſe. Now ſeeing that the cauſe of the Kings evill is fleagm, as Phyſicians ſay, ſetled in the kernels, which in other parts breeds other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he might be able by the ſame touch, and by the ſame vertue, to cure other diſeaſes that come from the ſame cauſe, which thing ſeeing hee cannot doe, it muſt neceſſarily follow that the cure is miraculous, or elſe that it depends on the imagination of the ſick. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:115445:231"/>the imagination of the ſick is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, being in ſome ſtronger, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers weaker, an uncertain event muſt be looked for from an uncertain cauſe. Therefore it muſt of neceſſity be either miraculous, or falſe, or diabolicall. I ſcarce believe that it is miraculous. The Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians did heale by touch alone; to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory of God, and the propagating of Chriſtian Religion. But God will not have miracles to be wrought at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans private pleaſure; thus what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Apoſtles did, they profeſſed that they did it not by any power of their owne, but in the name of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore thoſe ſeven Brethren, the Sonnes of <hi>Sceva</hi> a Jew, who went about in the ſame name to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the uncleane ſpirits, were beaten by the Devill, and ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their raſh boldneſſe. Thus it is not lawfull adventurouſly to attempt the working of miracles. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the power of curing the Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, is by the bleſſing of God granted to the Kings of great Brittaine, and France, which is denied to other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings: And ſo <hi>Edward the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> for his ſingular piety, cured not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:115445:232"/>the Kings Evill (which prerogative redounded to his Succeſſors after him) but alſo other ulcers by touch alone, which his Succeſſors could not doe. Seeing then this priviledge is onely vouchſafed to the aforeſaid Kings, and is wholly performed in the name of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> if other Kings ſhould attempt the ſame, it were too much raſhneſſe, and a groſſe tempting of God, who hath not given any ſuch power to them. Therefore in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where this diſeaſe of the Kings Evill is epidemicall and popular, <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> being taken Priſoner by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> cured it by his touch alone, as he was wont to doe <hi>France,</hi> concerning which <hi>Laſcaris</hi> hath this Epigramme.</p>

                  <p>Moreover it is to be noted, that the aforeſaid Kings on whom God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed that favour, have it upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain condition, nor is it derived unto their ſucceſſors, unleſſe they be lawfull heires, and abide in the Chriſtian Faith. For if an Uſurper (as there have been ſuch in times paſt, and God knowes what ſhall be the deſtinies of Kingdoms) ſhould depoſe a lawfull Prince from his Imperiall Throne, hee ſhould not with the Kingdome obtain this prerogative to himſelf. Nor if any King, though a lawfull Succeſſour to the Crown, ſhould renounce the Chriſtian Religion (as mens diſpoſitions are variable) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to another, ſhould he retaine that priviledge. For <hi>Beatus Remigius,</hi> with whoſe annointing this power redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> doubtleſſer an excellent Expoſitor of this thing, hath declared, that this power was granted to theſe Kings, ſo long as they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Catholick Faith, inſinuating thus much, that it ſhould ceaſe, if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they revolt from this Faith. Seeing then it is thus, who will believe that ſuch power is given to men of no account, to be perpetuall to them, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely from their birth,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:115445:233"/>which Kings alone do obtaine onely by unction, and on condition that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remaine in the Chriſtian Faith, ſeeing that God workes no miracles but to his owne greater glory, and for the confirmation of the Faith. Nor is it probable that God would give this gift unto Kings as a pledge of his favour, in token and teſtimony of their pietie, which hee had before vouchſafed to ſuch fellowes; and therefore ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (for a <hi>Seventh Sonne</hi> is ordinarily found) and which others alſo enjoy, who have ſometimes no religion at all in them. For that which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on Kings, ought to be ſuch a thing, that for the rarietie and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priviledge thereof, it muſt manifeſt more the glory of God, which it would not doe, if he had already beſtowed the like on others by their birth-right. Nor is there any promiſe to be found made from God to the <hi>Seventh Sonne;</hi> either before the foundation of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or afterwards, and it is a wonder that there were no <hi>Seventh Sonnes</hi> in the Apoſtles daies, that contended with them for the power of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when queſtionleſſe many families did abound with plentie of children.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:115445:233"/>Therefore it is manifeſt that this kinde of curing, if there be any ſuch is diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall. For wee know that the Devill Gods Ape, that hee may detract from Gods glory, doth imitate the ſame things which God, thus by his deceitfull craft he turned the Magicians Rods into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and by the confeſſion of ſome moderne Magicians, hee goes about mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically to repreſent and counterfeit the venerable rites and ceremonies of the Church, in their Magicall meetings: And ſo likewiſe, that this admirable prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, which God hath granted unto Kings, may be had in contempt, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to attempt the ſame by his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Emiſſaries.</hi> But God will not give his glory to another, neither will he ſuffer true miracles to be wrought by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil but falſe and counterfeit only. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore queſtionleſſe theſe fellowes doe either not at all cure this diſeaſe of the Kings-Evill which daily experience te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, or elſe the Devill (as hee uſes to doe in other diſeaſes) doth incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure it with naturall meanes, whoſe vertues hee is not ignorant of, which thing Phyſicians might be able to do, if they did certainely know the whole power of Nature. Yet it is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:115445:234"/>that this diſeaſe is more ordinary in children, and doth ariſe from fleam, which as they grow in age, is diſſolved by the increaſe of heat, and the diſeaſe goes away of it ſelfe, which is uſuall in many diſeaſes that appertain to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which if it happen, it ought not to be attributed to the uncertain vertue of him that touches it, but to Nature, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the <hi>Curer of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. L. <hi>The Antimoniall Cup, ſhewing the abuſe of it.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere is come not long ſince into uſe a Cup made of the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> ſo called by Alchymiſts, which is ſold at a very high rate, and is reported to be good for many things, and diſeaſes, both by him that makes it, and by the people who are alwaies eager in their purſuit after Novelties, and it is thought by the people to be a thing of great value, and heretofore not knowne to Phyſitians; when nevertheleſſe, it is very well knowne of all them that have any skill in the Chymicks; for the way of making the <hi>Regulus</hi> out of <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> is very eaſie, ordinary, and ancient. But that we may explicate to the people this errour ſo pernitious, wee will firſt ſpeake of the Cup it ſelfe, and then of its force. Now the Cup hath not its vertue from the Artificiall forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for ſo any Cup made of Silver and Gold ſhould doe the ſame. But it hath all its vertue from the <hi>Antimonie:</hi> Now they that pry into the nature of Minerals and Mettals, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Antinomie</hi> doth conſiſt of crude and very impure Sulphur, <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Arſenicke:</hi> And therefore it is ſo contrary to our nature, that after what manner ſoever it bee prepared and corrected, it doth even in the leaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:115445:235"/>that may be given, offer great violence to the intralls, and doth retaine its malignant quality, which can ſcarſe bee taken away by any infuſions. If by chance ſome man of a ſtrong conſtitution be able to indure the force thereof, he expels it upwards and downwards, with abundance of humours; but them that doth wonderfully gripe &amp; torment; For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are weake, and ſuch as doe vomit hardly it ſoever it be prepared, it never layes aſide its malignant and deadly quality.</p>
                  <p>Hence many grave Phyſitians, as <hi>Fernelius, Riolanus, Geſnerus,</hi> and the whole Colledge of Phyſitians at <hi>Paris,</hi> doe utterly diſlike the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall uſe thereof, in reſpect of its deadly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Nevertheleſſe to ſatisfie the people, wee will grant, that it may ſafely be uſed, ſo it bee rightly prepared, and diſcreetly applyed. I know it hath beene diverſly aſſayed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the art of the <hi>Alchimiſts,</hi> that though not altogether, yet at leaſt in ſome meaſure the malignitie thereof might bee abated, but that art is not yet fully found out, which can quite take away the force of that Medicament.</p>
                  <p>Now the common and more ordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, which are to be ſold even in all ſhops, are the <hi>regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> of which the aforeſaid Cup is made; the glaſſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonie,</hi> which the people call <hi>Stibium</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the true name of <hi>Antinomie</hi> it ſelfe, and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115445:235"/>of this Glaſſe, not of the <hi>Regulus</hi> ought this Cup to be made, ſaith <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Hartmannus</hi> in his notes upon <hi>Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> Moreover there are made of it <hi>Crocus metallorum,</hi> or the Saffron of mettals; <hi>Pulvis emeticus, Mercurius vita,</hi> a Tincture &amp; an Oyle.</p>
                  <p>And all theſe preparations are indeede with one and the ſame quality, to wit, vomiting and purging, which manifeſts that in none of the aforeſaid preparations was the deadlineſſe of the Antimony taken away. Now ſeeing that in all things; yea even in the worſt of all there are ſome degrees of pravitie, the people muſt know that in all Minerals, that preparation is accounted the beſt, and leaſt dangerous, in which the forme of the Metall is loſt; for then there is made a greater ſeparation of the pure from the impure: And therefore all Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts doe endeavour ſo to diſſolue Gold, a harmeleſſe medicament in it ſelfe, that the forme of the Mettall being layd aſide it may be made <hi>potable,</hi> and they doe not approve of any diſlolution therof, in which it can return to its owne nature; which is indeed much more true Minerals that are of a miſchievous nature. It is therefore to be noted that that Antimonie which we call crude, to wit, unprepared at all, is of no force to move the body, and therefore the Antients who were ignorant of Chymicall art, knew no inward uſe thereof. Now the firſt
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115445:236"/>and eaſieſt preparation of all, is that, which we call the <hi>Regulus,</hi> in which the forme of the Mettall is not taken away, but doth melt into to a certaine forme of Lead. Hence <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, that Antimonie melted turnes to Lead, having ſome light knowledge of that <hi>Regulus.</hi> for it is made of it being melted onely, and ſo a little refined, and it doth retaine all maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Antimonie, which laid as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe before, under the earthly excrement. This doe Mettall-men uſe, and mixe in Guns, Bels, and other the like engines: but ſeeing it doth yet poſſeſſe all the naughty and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous qualities of Antimonie, it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, that the Cup made of it is moſt dangerous. Therefore the beſt Alchymiſts have quite abandoned it from any uſe in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, ſave that by a further preparation may be extracted out of this <hi>Regulus</hi> the glaſſe of Antimonie, and many other ſuch things farre better then the <hi>Regulus</hi> it ſelfe. Wherefore ſome in the ſtead thereof have uſed the glaſſe of Antimonie, as did frequently that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Phyſitian <hi>Matthiolus;</hi> the people call it <hi>Stibium,</hi> and are ſore afraid of it, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it ought to be preferred before the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus.</hi> Nevertheleſſe <hi>Quercitanus, Hartman,</hi> and ſome others of principall note among the Alchymiſts, who doe highly extoll the vertue of Antimonie, doe thinke this preparation of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:115445:236"/>the mixture of impure Sulphur, which is not yet taken away. And therefore waving thoſe two as not ſafe, they doe familiarly uſe the <hi>Crocus,</hi> or <hi>Hepar Antimonij,</hi> Saffron or liver of Antimony; <hi>Puluis emiticus,</hi> the vomiting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> Mercury of the life: Which preparations the Colledge of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at <hi>London</hi> hath inſerted in their diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and there is almoſt no ſhop, in which both the ſubſtance and infuſion of them is not to be ſold. From whence they that doe ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll this Cup, may gather, that they uſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious and dangerous remedy, whereas the ſame much better prepared is every where obvious, and to be ſold, yet at a very eaſie rate</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the force of the Cup.</head>
                     <p>AS touching the force of the Cup, it doth not gently but mightily provoke vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and ſtooles; now every vomit although it be cauſed by the moſt gentle Medicines of all, is nevertheleſſe alwaies more harſh to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then any Purgation by the inferior parts, becauſe the ſtomacke was not made for expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but for reception; for it is one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, and of exquiſite ſence, and hath a very great ſympathy with the Braine and the heart, in ſo much as when it is affected, the people thinke and complaine that their heart akes. It is therefore not good to ſtraine ſuch
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:115445:237"/>a noble part with ſuch a violent medicine. But beſides, a vomit doth offer much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the ſtrength of the whole Body, ſtraine head, braine, muſcles of the belly, the breaſt, and all the intrailes which are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the lower belly, and ſometimes in groſſe bodies breakes the veines, and lets out the bloud. Wherefore if wee muſt not uſe other purging medicines, but with a great deale of care and premeditation, much leſſe vomitaries; for of all evacuations a vomit is the moſt grievous and dangerous. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many things are to bee regarded in the provoking of vomit. <hi>First,</hi> the nature of the Patient, and his aptneſſe or difficulty for vomiting, for in them that vomit hardly, there is a great deale of danger, although they bee ſick of diſeaſe which might bee cured by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Such are they that are fat, thoſe that are ſtrait breſted, many ſlender perſons, who have weak ſtomacks, ſuch as are ſubject to a Cough, or difficulty of breathing, which have Tumours or Ulcers in their breſts, they that have weak heads and eyes, and ſuch as are troubled with the inflammation, or pain in the Midriffe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the time of the yeare is to be conſidered, for it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient at every time of the yeare. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the nature of the diſeaſes; for in ſome diſeaſes it doth more hurt than good, and in thoſe
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115445:237"/>wherein it may doe good, it muſt not yet be alwayes uſed; and therfore the founder of the Cup is miſtaken, when he ſaith that, that the Cup is good for all the diſeaſes which ſtand in need of purging, as we ſhall manifeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the conſtitution of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; for it cannot bee adminiſtred at all times of diſeaſes without danger to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: The Phyſician muſt conſider in all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations the beginning, increaſing, ſtate of the diſeaſe, much more in a vomit. <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> great care is to bee had of preparing the body and the humours, and many things are to be regarded both before the vomit, and in the very act of vomiting, which are not to be handled in this place. So as there is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation which requires ſo much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that which is done by vomit. Now ſeeing theſe things can be knowne only by a Phyſician, and that not every one, but by a very learned and ſkilfull man, I cannot but wonder at the adventurous raſhneſſe of ſome men, yea and women, who being unread in the rules of Phyſick, groſſely ignorant both of Diſeaſes and their cauſes, their times, and not knowing the method of Curing, dare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe vex and torment ſuch a noble ſubject as Mans body with variety of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. <hi>Secondly,</hi> perſwade unto vomit, the moſt dangerous and difficult evacuation of all
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:115445:238"/>other. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> provoke it with a Minerall, which is moſt contrary to nature. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To doe it with <hi>Antimonie,</hi> then which no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is more churliſh. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to uſe that preparation of it, which is the very worſt of all. Not that I doe altogether diſlike the uſe of Antimonie, for I have often uſed it with good ſucceſſe, but better prepared. But eſpecially the founder of the Cup is to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for ſelling ſuch a cheap medicine at ſo deare a rate, the right uſe whereof hee doth neither teach the people, nor I think he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowes: And therefore I have known many, who by taking the infuſion of it, have been grievouſly tormented, and ſome that have dyed, who deſpiſing the counſell of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicans have prepoſterouſly uſed it. For Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick although it bee in its owne nature very good, and is the hand of God, yet it is but like a ſword in the hand of a mad man, as we have ſaid in another place out of <hi>Herophilus.</hi>

It is (ſaith he) a Minerall according to <hi>Paracelſus</hi>) conſiſting of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Sulphur and ſalt; So is my glove according to the ſaid <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> It was firſt diſcovered (ſaith he) by <hi>Geber</hi> King of <hi>Arabia;</hi> and yet <hi>Dioſcorides, Galen, Hippocrates,</hi> and ancienter Authors before <hi>Geber</hi> doe ſpeake of it: And he called it <hi>Magneſia,</hi> as if <hi>Geber</hi> ſpake Latine, but <hi>Quercetanus</hi> calls it ſo indeed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> amongſt all the medicines that are prepared out of this minerall, he diſclaimes from all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Regulus,</hi> in which hee ſhewes his weakneſſe, for the <hi>Rugulus</hi> is the weakeſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt, and courſeſt preparation of all others; therefore he addes, <hi>and what may bee conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prepared out of the ſame;</hi> and that I like well, for out of the <hi>Regulus</hi> may be drawn the flowers, the glaſſe of Antimonie, the <hi>Crocus metallor,</hi> and many other preparations; and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:115445:239"/>herein I adhere to the authority of <hi>Bornettus,</hi> and <hi>Mylius,</hi> cited by him; who doe not ſay, that it is to be uſed in Phyſick, but that it is the chiefeſt examination of Gold, and the true matter of all flowers, and medicinall tinctures contained within <hi>Antimonie,</hi> which is true; for the flowers and other <hi>Antimoniall</hi> extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be properly drawn out of the <hi>regulus</hi> and the worſt of them is better then the <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> it ſelf: Then he brings in <hi>Paracelſus</hi> with the Titles of <hi>Orientall Star, of Naturall, Spagiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and Magneticall</hi> light and knowledge. Now I am ſure no learned and honeſt man will approve of ſuch an illiterate man as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> was, approving and practiſing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Arts, which he calls the <hi>Syrupes and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries of the Devill.</hi> But let us heare what he ſayes, in his Book <hi>de vitâ longâ, pag.</hi> 167. cited by this Writer, not a word of the Cup, but only of the praiſes of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> as <hi>Alehy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> uſe to doe, that is, beyond the deſerts thereof, and that it cures the Leproſſe, which notwithſtanding <hi>Paracelſus</hi> never performed therewithall, but howſoever hee never uſed the <hi>Regulus,</hi> or the Cup, but hath many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preparations of <hi>Antimonie</hi> then that Cup is, as appeares by the next authority cited by him out of his 6. Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. Where he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes all theſe vertues to the quinteſſence of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> the <hi>Regulus</hi> being not the eſſence
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:115445:239"/>of it, but amongſt all preparations the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and unſafeſt; and all the paſſages alledged out of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doe intimate no more, but only that <hi>Antimonie</hi> is an excellent medicine, that cures (ſaith he) the Leproſie, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other diſeaſes; but for theſe two I am ſure it is falſe, for neither by the Cup, nor by any other <hi>Antimonial</hi> preparation can it be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And I beleeve <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpake he knew not what, when he ſaith, <hi>As that Antimony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Gold, ſo by the ſame reaſon it purifies the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man.</hi> He muſt be voyd of reaſon, who will thinke this compariſon true and right, as if there were the ſame reaſon for Gold a Minerall, having ſome convenience of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with another Minerall, and the body of man, with which it hath no convenience at all: For the ſame might be as well ſaid of all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging medicines, that cleanſe the body of man from all its impurities; but howſoever the Cup is not the right preparation of it to give to cleanſe mans body. He brings a ſecond au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Martinus Rulandus,</hi> who calls his <hi>Aqua-benedicta</hi> the infuſion of this Cup, which is abſolutely falſe, and <hi>Quercetanus, Labavius, Sennertus,</hi> and <hi>Hartmanus</hi> upon <hi>Crollius,</hi> yea his own Son <hi>Rulandus</hi> ſayes otherwiſe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his <hi>Aqua-benedicta</hi> which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends ſo much was made of <hi>Antimonie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not of the Cup, but of the <hi>Crocus
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:115445:240"/>metallor,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Hepar antimonij,</hi> the liver of <hi>Antimonie,</hi> or ſome other better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; as if he did ſay, that it was the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Cup, yet it is not to be uſed by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, except they have the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgment that <hi>Rulandus</hi> hath; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he uſed other medicines as bad as this, which hee doth commend as much, as his <hi>Extractum Eſula,</hi> which is abſolutely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by him before all other medicines, and <hi>Antimony</hi> it ſelfe, ſhewing that no medicine is good for every body. But <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> have that property, to extoll things to the ſkies, but when they come to the tryall, they are found falſe, or elſe loſe their vertues in other folkes hands: As for example, that it cured the frenſie, it is falſe, for in the diſeaſes of the head, vomiting is very hurtfull, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Phyſicians: That it cured the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſickneſs, it were to be deſired, but it doth not prove ſo, except that come from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, the head being onely affected by the ſympathy of the ſaid ſtomack. That it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Impoſtumes in the Lungs, and cures the Pleuriſie, it is moſt untrue: For breaking the Impoſtumes in the Lungs, if it be given when they are at maturity, perhaps it will, becauſe of the great ſtraining of the upper parts of the body, but another vomit may do the like, if the man can bear it. The truth is, thoſe that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:115445:240"/>have Impoſtumes in the Lungs, are ſo ſhort winded, that they cannot beare the ſtraining of a vomit; but howſoever for an Impoſtume to bee broken, and to be healed, are two ſeverall things, a vomit may doe the former, but not the latter. Concerning the Pleuriſie; the Phyſician that gives ſuch a purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that works upward as well as down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in ſuch a diſeaſe, is much to be blamed, for working againſt the rules of Phyſick. <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetanus</hi> is ſo bold in his <hi>Pharmacopoeâ,</hi> as to ſpeak of ſuch a cure, but not in a right Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, but becauſe that Book is full of lyes, I will ſay no more but this, namely, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor <hi>Rulandus</hi> ever uſed the <hi>Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Cup, or the <hi>Regulus</hi> out of which it is made, nor was <hi>Quercetanus</hi> his <hi>Aqua-benedicta</hi> made of it; for he himſelfe ſayes plainely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he brings the book called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilica Antimonij,</hi> commending <hi>Antimony,</hi> but not the Cup: And to ſhew how largely theſe <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> ſpeak, he ſayes it cures the <hi>French Pox, Leproſie, Gout,</hi> and <hi>Falling ſickneſſe,</hi> which never a one of them ever performed, and yet the <hi>Baſilica</hi> ſpeakes of that preparation of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> that provokes ſweating, as well as of others. So I may ſay the like of <hi>Crollius,</hi> who commends the <hi>Antimony,</hi> but not the Cup, and ſo <hi>Mylius,</hi> and <hi>Bornettus,</hi> who commends the <hi>Antinomy,</hi> but not a word of the Cup. As
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:115445:241"/>for <hi>Mylius</hi> he is but a tranſcriber of other mens works, and hath compiled a mighty great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume without any judgment, word by word out of <hi>Paracelſus, Quercetanus,</hi> and others, and hath indifferently put in true or falſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he found written, ſo I will not give a ſtraw for his opinion, when he commends the <hi>Antimony</hi> againſt diſeaſes, which none of them did ever cure. For <hi>Bornettus,</hi> I know him well, he wrote his Booke, being very young, and I do not think he believes, that the <hi>French Pox,</hi> and the <hi>Leproſie</hi> may be cured by thoſe meanes. Thus I have ſifted all the authorities of this man in the behalfe of his Cup, which prove only that <hi>Antimony</hi> is an excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, powerfull in operation, and too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull in deed, but that the Cup is the pure eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it, none of them ſay, nor will any man that hath any ſkill in <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Beſides he brings ſome Phyſicians li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (and ſome very well knowne to me, but the greateſt part I know not) who (as hee ſaith) have approved his Cup: I will make a good interpretation of their judgment, for without queſtion the infuſion of his Cup will will worke, and ſuch bodies might bee met withall, in which it hath ſo powerfully wrought, that being able to beare it, they have received much good by it, but that they have ſaid that his Cup was better and ſafer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:115445:241"/>preparations of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or then other purging medicines, and that a woman having bought it, hath alſo gained knowledge when, and in what diſeaſes to apply it, I will not wrong their judgement ſo much as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>

                     <head>Of the vertues of the Cup.</head>
                     <p>NOw to come to the vertues of the Cup, he makes a great liſt of all the diſeaſes for which it is good, naming almoſt all diſeaſes that have need of purging from head to foot, without diſtinction of the ſeverall cauſes of them, the Cup is good for them, becauſe it purges, and by the ſame reaſon all purging medicines may doe the like, and are good for the ſame diſeaſes, for nature hath provided variety of remedies, ſome ſtrong, ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of all ſorts, that the Phyſician may chuſe what he thinks moſt fit for his Patient, for one and the ſame remedy, in the ſame diſeaſe, is not fit for every one. When we read the Books of <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> they commend other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as much as <hi>Antinomy</hi> for the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. But let us a little conſider ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſeaſes named in his Pamphlet, which I doe except againſt; It cures perfectly the <hi>French Pox,</hi> the <hi>Kings evill,</hi> the <hi>Falling ſickneſs,</hi> as he ſaith in the 9, 10, and 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Mark, which is falſe; nay I ſay more, it is a very groſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115445:242"/>and raſh boldneſs in him, or any man, to preſcribe the infuſion of this cup in the <hi>Plague,</hi> ſmall <hi>Pox,</hi> ſpotted <hi>Fever,</hi> and <hi>Purples;</hi> for all violent medicines that draw the venemous humours of theſe diſeaſes within the body, which nature doth expell to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, doe work againſt the rules of art. It is alſo falſe that any vomit is good for the Pleuriſie; and ſo I ſay the like of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If the Founder of this Cup had well knowne the nature of theſe diſeaſes, hee would never have ſaid ſo. Indeed where nature hath need of purging or vomiting, this Cup may ſerve, obſerving all that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the uſe of thoſe evacuations; for we doe not deny that it will work, but this we ſay, that it being the worſt and unſafeſt preparation of all others, it is better to uſe ſome other then it, and all thoſe diſeaſes that he brings experience for, (leaving out thoſe that have been killed by it) might have been performed by other vomits, made out of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> or other ſimples working the ſame effect.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the manner of uſing the Cup.</head>
                     <p>NOw the manner of uſing the Cup ſhewes the weakneſſe of the man, he bids to put the Cup into a pot, and cover it with liquor, to be above the Cup an inch or two, then to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:115445:242"/>boyle it gently for two houres, and ſo to keep it warm for twelve houres, then to take a cup full of it or more, and the quantity of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is a pinte of wine for two, yet it workes better, ſayes he, if two or three cup-fuls be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and he is bold to ſay, that it works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence, gives counſell if it ſhould work three or four dayes together, not to ſtop it, and in the end to beware of counterfeit Cups. Here are as many errours as words; <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is needleſſe to ſhape the <hi>Regulus</hi> into a Cup, ſeeing the Wine is not to be infuſed in the Cup, but the Cup in the Wine in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot. Is not a little lump of the ſame <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> without any particular ſhape, as good as a Cup of it? And if one doe ſteepe it, will it not think you infuſe its vertues into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as well as the Cup, and beſt of all if it were in powder? But thus the <hi>Regulus</hi> had been bought too cheap, but we muſt have it a Cup or a Ring (forſooth) to make the people beleeve it is not an ordinary thing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> being thus prepared by boyling, makes the drink look ſo diſtaſtfully, and makes it to loſe its vertue, ſo as if a child hath need of halfe a pint, a ſtrong man of two or three, as he ſayes. Let the Reader goe to an <hi>Apothearies</hi> Shop in any part of the Kingdome, there he may finde <hi>Stibium,</hi> which is <hi>Antimony</hi> in glaſſe, of this let him take ſix graines weight, let them ſteep
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:115445:243"/>cloſely in two or three ſpoonefuls of white-wine, and it will be every whit as pure as it was without any taſte, and it will worke as well, and more ſafely; but if you feare the <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> (not without cauſe) take as much of the <hi>Regulus</hi> out of which he makes his Cup, uſe it as I have ſaid, and it will worke in as little quantity. Yea ſteep the cup in a quart of wine cloſe without any fire, for a fortnight, give but two or three ounces of that Wine, and it will work with a better effect. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that it workes without any violence, it is not ſo, for I know many that have taken it, who have been grievouſly tormented with it, and this is common to all vomits, yea even when they are provoked by the ſtrength of nature. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, it is a pernicious counſell to ſuffer a ſuperpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Phyſick to work ſo long, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen well in ſome ſtrong bodies, it is not to be thought that it will do ſo in every one. <hi>The Laſt,</hi> to beware of counterfeit Cups, is to keep the people continually bound to him; for (ſaith he) if it bee broken, bring it to him in weight, and for ten ſhillings he will give you a new one. This is the beſt trick of all his Booke, a pound of <hi>Antimony</hi> unprepared is hardly worth above ſix pence in the <hi>Druggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> Shop, for 12 pence, or 18 pence more, of that pound one may have halfe a pound and more of this <hi>Regulus,</hi> what at the caſting of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:115445:243"/>it into a Cup is worth, let any body judge; in very deed three Cups of 4 or 5 ounces a piece, doe not ſtand the maker to above ten ſhillings. Beſides when the Cup is broken, the vertues are not broken, the pieces being ſteeped doe retaine the ſame vertue, and will work the ſame effect, as when the Cup was whole. The mettall then being ſo good cheap, and the preparation of it ſo eaſie, there is no great feare of counterfeit ones, for a counterfeit one is like to coſt more then a right one.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I ſay, though this Cup ſhould be ſo admirable, yet it is beyond the capacitie of any that is not a Phyſician, to adapte the right uſe of it to every perſon, for all diſeaſes, times, and places, as we have ſaid already; nor doe I thinke the Founder himſelf hath the knowledge of theſe things.</p>
